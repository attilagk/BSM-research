strelka2 somatic,mixing data simulated from NA12878 and NA12877,"mixing sequencing data of unrelated individuals to simulate impure tumor and matched normal samples. For this purpose, we used NA12878 and NA12877 to represent, respectively, the tumor and normal samples. We simulated datasets with tumor purities of 20%, 50%, and 80%, and one matched normal sample with 90% purity. The truth set for these evaluations were the Platinum Genomes 13 variants in NA12878 where the corresponding NA12877 genotype is homozygous reference.",somatic variants,paired,http://strelka-public.s3.amazonaws.com,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/25/192872,Strelka2

Genome-in-a-bottle 1000 genomes,mixing data Illumina-sequenced) by 1000 Genome from NA12878 and NA19129,"Whole exome sequencing data of NA12878 and NA18489 were obtained from the 1,000 Genomes Project [25]. Raw reads were mapped to the hg19 human reference genome sequence (GRCh37) by the 1,000 Genomes Project. The publicly available read alignment files in BAM format were generated with BWA mapping, GATK local realignment around known indels, GATK base quality score recalibration, and Picard MarkDuplicates. Each BAM file was randomly downsampled using Picard command-line tools with various percentages to achieve the following mixture concentrations: 8%, 16%, 36%, and 50%. One NA12878 downsampled result and one NA18489 downsampled result were then merged using SAMtools [26]. This step was repeated for different mixture percentages to create an in silico dilution series. Consequently, the primary NA18489 sequencing results represent the virtual normal sample and the NA12878 dilution series were treated as the matched virtual tumor samples.",somatic variants,paired,https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3986649/,Xu et al 2014
Genome-in-a-bottle amplicon,mixing data amplicon-sequenced by authors from NA12878 and NA19129,"DNA samples of NA12878 and NA19129 were purchased from Coriell Institute. Sample mixtures were created based on the actual amplifiable DNA in each sample, resulting in 0%, 8%, 16%, 36%, and 100% of NA12878 sample mixed in the NA19129 sample, respectively. We treated the mixed samples at 8%, 16%, 36%, and 100% as the virtual tumor samples and the 0% as the virtual normal sample. Therefore, we produced artificially matched tumor-normal samples to call somatic SNVs. QIAGEN’s GeneRead DNAseq Comprehensive Cancer Gene Panel (Version 1) was used to amplify the target region of interest (124 genes, 800 Kb). Targeted enrichment and library construction were done following manufacturer’s user manual (QIAGEN). Briefly, 160 ng of each virtual tumor sample or virtual normal sample were PCR amplified and purified. For each sample, one quarter of the PCR product was used for constructing a barcoded Illumina DNA library. Libraries were quantified using QIAGEN’s GeneRead DNAseq Library Quant System, and were mixed in equal amount. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was performed following manufacturer’s user manual (Illumina) to generate FASTQ files, resulting in median coverage depth of 500–700x for each sample. Experiments were performed in triplicate. The sequencing reads were aligned to the reference genome using BWA [24], then preprocessed according to Broad best practice guidance (indel realignment, base quality score recalibration, and base alignment quality scoring). Finally, the primer sequences were trimmed away from the pre-processed reads before variant calling.",somatic variants,paired,https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3986649/,Xu et al 2014
real tumor,ultra-deep targeted re-sequencing of tumor sample,"The union of putative somatic mutations, except intronic and intergenic positions, reported by the nine somatic variant callers was used to select chromosomal candidate regions for targeted deep sequencing.  Additional genomic positions were included as related cancer samples from the same patients formed the basis for selecting targeted regions, described in Krøigård et al. [21], therefore the variant callers had a chance to report low allele frequency variants found in other steps of cancer progression when presented with increasing coverage.  In total, 21,970 chromosomal regions were targeted. Target enrichment was performed using SureSelect DNA enrichment methodology (Agilent). A custom SureSelect enrichment kit was designed using the Agilent SureDesign application (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/suredesign/). Library construction and SureSelect enrichment were performed according to manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform with paired end sequencing 2 x 100 bases. Deep sequencing resulted in a mean coverage of 362 x of the targeted positions (S1 Table). Alignment and data preprocessing were performed as described above. Variant calling of the targeted sequencing data was performed by the nine variant callers using the same settings as for exome sequencing data (Table 1).  For deep sequencing data only positions covered by at least 200 x are included in the data analyses.",somatic variants,single,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4803342/,Krøigård et al 2016
Implanted-simulated,implant known polymorphisms and cancer somatic mutations into GRCh37 then simulate NGS reads,"Reference genomes and variant implantation: To emulate realistic genomes of cancer patients, we implanted 5,381,311 SNVs, insertions and deletions representing the European-Caucasian ancestry [11, 21] into the GRCh37 human reference genome [22]. The diploid control genome consisted of two independently created genomes representing the maternal and paternal lineage.  Tumor data was generated from the control genome by inserting 32,422 known cancer variants from the ICGC and COSMIC [23] databases into our control genome. We repeated this ten times to create five maternal and five paternal cancer genomes, each containing a random subset of the selected cancer variants. To obtain heterogeneous tumor genomes with different allele compositions and frequencies, we combined the five maternal and paternal cancer genomes in randomized proportions. Finally, we simulated ten tumors using a range of 0% to 90% admixture with control sequence. Fig 1 summarizes the variants present in the parental genomes.  Simulation approach for synthetic genomes: For each tumor data set, we used Wessim [24] to generate 100 bp Illumina reads with a mean insert size of 300 bp (standard deviation 100) for exome and 200 bp (s.d. 50) for panel data, and median coverage of 70x and 520x for exon and panel data, respectively. Wessim applies a sequencing error model with distinct error rates for substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and employs BLAT [25] to mimic probe hybridization. We used Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon v5 probes for whole exome and the Molecular Health Pan-Cancer Gene Panel covering 542 cancer-relevant genes (S1 File) for the gene panel read simulations, which covered 50,390,601 and 2,383,840 nucleotides, respectively. Because the gene panel only covered a limited number of nucleotides, we risked having too few somatic variants for a reliable and sensitive analysis of false negatives. To solve this issue, we simulated a hypermutated tumor for the panel analyses with a high number of somatic variants. After producing the reads, we aligned each data set to the GRCh37 reference using Novoalign 3.04.06 [26] without soft clipping. As recommended by the GATK Best Practices, SNVs were directly called from these alignments using HaplotypeCaller and MuTect2. For all other callers, the alignments were first realigned around indels using GATK IndelRealigner 3.6 [27].",somatic variants,paired,https://zenodo.org/record/556347#.WinJbK3U8UE,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5636151/,Bohnert et al 2017
Implanted-simulated,implanted somatic variants from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and simulated reads,"A tumor sample is composed of several genetically distinct subclones [5]. In order to generate a realistic scenario for somatic variant calling of tumor samples with intra-tumor heterogeneity, we explicitly generated eight diploid simulated cancer genomes (clones) and one diploid normal genome. Variants detected in a WES tumor-normal sample pair of human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) were placed into these genomes using the software library SeqAn [36]. Variants detected only in the normal sample were placed into the normal genome, equally likely as homozygous or heterozygous mutations. All cancer genomes inherit the normal variants. The cancer clones are related by a clonal ancestry tree, shown in Additional file 1: Figure A. Variants detected only in the real tumor sample are randomly assigned to one of the nodes of the tree. All children of this node inherit the variant. A total of 217,507 somatic and 456,680 germline mutations found in the real ccRCC and its matched normal sample were put in the phylogenetic tree.  Finally, reads are generated from the normal genome and the clones using the software library SeqAn [36] and Wessim [37]. The tumor sample was generated by mixing the reads from the clones and varying proportions of reads from the normal sample. The weighting of the clones was determined by drawing a Dirichlet-distributed random vector.",somatic variants,paired,European Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB14772,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5209852/,Hofmann et al 2017
International Cancer Genome Consortium MB,target capture and sequencing with two independent platforms,"We conducted a first benchmark exercise using WGS data generated from a CLL tumour-normal pair and then a second using a case of MB. Both tumour types were expected to have relatively low mutational load and not very pervasive structural changes: CLL has a few known translocations and large copy number variants, and MB exhibits a large degree of tetraploidy but is otherwise typically free of complex rearrangements. The quality of the CLL data was below today's standards but typical for the time it was produced, while the quality of the MB library preparation and produced sequence were of high quality. The validation strategies also differed. For CLL we chose to validate submitted mutations by target capture and sequencing with two independent platforms (MiSeq and IonTorrent). This approach was limited by technical issues inherent to target capture and sequencing on these other platforms, which led to a low rate of independently validated mutations. Moreover, the real false-negative (FN) rates were underestimated because of the limited coverage provided to participants. For the MB data set, ∼300 × in sequence reads were generated by five different sequencing centres, which we joined and used to create a curated set of mutations. The MB tumour presented with a tetraploid background combined with other changes of ploidy in chromosomes 1, 4, 8, 15 and 17 (Supplementary Fig. 1), giving us the opportunity to benchmark performance at lower mutant allele frequencies. Moreover, the high depth and relatively unbiased coverage of the genome enabled higher sensitivity in mutation detection leading to a more inclusive set of curated mutations. For these reasons, we present here only the results for the MB benchmark.",somatic variants,paired,European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) under the accession number EGAS00001001539,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682041,International Cancer Genome Consortium 2015
