title: Testing the BICseq tool
---

The BICseq R package was installed both locally, on my laptop and on Minerva.  The critical segmentation step of the BICseq workflow fails, however.

Load package (warnings, messages suppressed)

```{r results=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(BICseq)
```

Using the test data supplied with BICseq create a BICseq object

```{r}
bs <- BICseq(sample = "../../data/BICseq/tumor_sorted.bam",
             reference = "../../data/BICseq/normal_sorted.bam", seqNames = "chr22")
str(bs)
```

The BICseq object appears to be OK.  Segmentation, however, fails

```{r}
segs <- getBICseg(object = bs)
```
