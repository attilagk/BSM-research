## Scaling with segment length


```r
runt <- read.csv("results/runtimes.csv")
```

`runtimes.csv` was generated by the `parser.sh` script after running strelka and mutect2 using `docall.sh` on various length alignment-pairs generated by `aln-subregion`.  Each alignment pair corresponds to a genomic segment of certain length and a certain tissue pair (one of muscle-NeuN_mn, muscle-NeuN_pl, NeuN_mn-NeuN_pl) in individual MSSM179.  Note that the NeuN_pl sample was sequenced at a much higher depth than the muscle or NeuN_mn sample.   All alignments starts at 1:100,000,000 (100 MB of chromosome 1) but end at some position such that the lengths form a sequence of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 megabases.  This setup allows to study the dependence of caller runtime on

1. the caller (strelka or mutect2)
1. length of genomic segment
1. read depth
