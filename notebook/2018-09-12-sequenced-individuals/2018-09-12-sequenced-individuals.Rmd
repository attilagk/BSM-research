Which individuals have been sequenced?

For the answer see the `src/sequenced-individuals.sh` as well as the `data/dnalib/get-cmc-individuals` scripts.

```{r engine="bash"}
indivs=$HOME/projects/bsm/results/2018-09-12-sequenced-individuals/sequenced-individuals
cat $indivs
```

Thus the number of sequenced individuals is

```{r engine="bash", echo=FALSE}
indivs=$HOME/projects/bsm/results/2018-09-12-sequenced-individuals/sequenced-individuals
wc -w $indivs
```
