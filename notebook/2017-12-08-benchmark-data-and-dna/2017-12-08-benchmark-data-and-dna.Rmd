title: Benchmark Data and DNA
---

Our goal is to generate a paired sample NGS data set in order to benchmark and optimize variant calling workflows for BSM.  Several approaches have been described to generating benchmark data sets.  The most recent and cutting-edge resources are Platinum Genomes (Illumina) and the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, which offer DNA for several genomes with high confidence germline variants as well as NGS data based on those, generated with various technologies and at various depths.  Some of these genomes are from trios or larger pedigrees.  Therefore these resources support the "mixing approach" to generating a paired sample data set, where for both samples are the result of mixing two genomes but the mixing ratio differs between the samples.

## Resources

### Platinum Genomes

See [Illumina's Platinum website][platinum] and the corresponding [article by Eberle et al 2017][Eberle].

### Genome in a Bottle

| The Genome in a Bottle Consortium is a public-private-academic consortium hosted by NIST to develop the technical infrastructure (reference standards, reference methods, and reference data) to enable translation of whole human genome sequencing to clinical practice. The priority of GIAB is authoritative characterization of human genomes for use in analytical validation and technology development, optimization, and demonstration. In 2015, NIST released the pilot genome Reference Material 8398, which is genomic DNA (NA12878) derived from a large batch of the Coriell cell line GM12878, characterized for high-confidence SNPs, indel, and homozygous reference regions ([Zook, et al., Nature Biotechnology 2014][Zook]).

For general description see [http://jimb.stanford.edu/giab][GIAB]; for available NGS data sets see [genome-in-a-bottle/giab_data_indexes](https://github.com/genome-in-a-bottle/giab_data_indexes).

## Previous approaches to benchmark data

A list of previous approaches and related publications and resources---far from complete---is available [in this table]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/projects/bsm/benchmarking-data.csv).  It can be seen that the most recent studies tend to take advantage of Platinum Genomes and Genome in a Bottle.  To summarize the table the following general approaches may be distinguished (TODO):

* one
* two
