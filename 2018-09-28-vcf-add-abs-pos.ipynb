      "The \"with\" statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with\n",
      "methods defined by a context manager (see section *With Statement\n",
      "Context Managers*). This allows common \"try\"...\"except\"...\"finally\"\n",
      "usage patterns to be encapsulated for convenient reuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "   with_stmt ::= \"with\" with_item (\",\" with_item)* \":\" suite\n",
      "   with_item ::= expression [\"as\" target]\n",
      "\n",
      "The execution of the \"with\" statement with one \"item\" proceeds as\n",
      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The context expression (the expression given in the \"with_item\")\n",
      "   is evaluated to obtain a context manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The context manager's \"__exit__()\" is loaded for later use.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The context manager's \"__enter__()\" method is invoked.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If a target was included in the \"with\" statement, the return\n",
      "   value from \"__enter__()\" is assigned to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Note: The \"with\" statement guarantees that if the \"__enter__()\"\n",
      "     method returns without an error, then \"__exit__()\" will always be\n",
      "     called. Thus, if an error occurs during the assignment to the\n",
      "     target list, it will be treated the same as an error occurring\n",
      "     within the suite would be. See step 6 below.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The suite is executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The context manager's \"__exit__()\" method is invoked.  If an\n",
      "   exception caused the suite to be exited, its type, value, and\n",
      "   traceback are passed as arguments to \"__exit__()\". Otherwise, three\n",
      "   \"None\" arguments are supplied.\n",
      "\n",
      "   If the suite was exited due to an exception, and the return value\n",
      "   from the \"__exit__()\" method was false, the exception is reraised.\n",
      "   If the return value was true, the exception is suppressed, and\n",
      "   execution continues with the statement following the \"with\"\n",
      "   statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "   If the suite was exited for any reason other than an exception, the\n",
      "   return value from \"__exit__()\" is ignored, and execution proceeds\n",
      "   at the normal location for the kind of exit that was taken.\n",
