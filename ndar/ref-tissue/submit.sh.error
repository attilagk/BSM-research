WARNING: Non unique body parts! In a port, as per BP 1.1 R2710 operations must have unique operation signature on the wire for successful dispatch. Methods [updateUserQueue, addUploadFiles] have the same request body block {http://gov/nih/ndar/ws/datamanager/server/bean/jaxb}UserQueueElement. Method dispatching may fail, runtime will try to dispatch using SOAPAction. Another option is to enable AddressingFeature to enabled runtime to uniquely identify WSDL operation using wsa:Action header.
