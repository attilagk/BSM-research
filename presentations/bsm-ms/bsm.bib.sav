abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

abstract = {Somatic mosaicism refers to the occurrence of two genetically distinct populations of cells within an individual, derived from a postzygotic mutation. In contrast to inherited mutations, somatic mosaic mutations may affect only a portion of the body and are not transmitted to progeny. These mutations affect varying genomic sizes ranging from single nucleotides to entire chromosomes and have been implicated in disease, most prominently cancer. The phenotypic consequences of somatic mosaicism are dependent upon many factors including the developmental time at which the mutation occurs, the areas of the body that are affected, and the pathophysiological effect(s) of the mutation. The advent of second-generation sequencing technologies has augmented existing array-based and cytogenetic approaches for the identification of somatic mutations. We outline the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques and highlight recent insights into the role of somatic mosaicism in causing cancer, neurodegenerative, monogenic, and complex disease.},

abstract = {A new method is developed for calculating sequence substitution probabilities using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The basic strategy is to use uniformization to transform the original continuous time Markov process into a Poisson substitution process and a discrete Markov chain of state transitions. An efficient MCMC algorithm for evaluating substitution probabilities by this approach using a continuous gamma distribution to model site-specific rates is outlined. The method is applied to the problem of inferring branch lengths and site-specific rates from nucleotide sequences under a general time-reversible (GTR) model and a computer program BYPASSR is developed. Simulations are used to examine the performance of the new program relative to an existing program BASEML that uses a discrete approximation for the gamma distributed prior on site-specific rates. It is found that BASEML and BYPASSR are in close agreement when inferring branch lengths, regardless of the number of rate categories used, but that BASEML tends to underestimate high site-specific substitution rates, and to overestimate intermediate rates, when fewer than 50 rate categories are used. Rate estimates obtained using BASEML agree more closely with those of BYPASSR as the number of rate categories increases. Analyses of the posterior distributions of site-specific rates from BYPASSR suggest that a large number of taxa are needed to obtain precise estimates of site-specific rates, especially when rates are very high or very low. The method is applied to analyze 45 sequences of the alpha 2B adrenergic receptor gene (A2AB) from a sample of eutherian taxa. In general, the pattern expected for regions under negative selection is observed with third codon positions having the highest inferred rates, followed by first codon positions and with second codon positions having the lowest inferred rates. Several sites show exceptionally high substitution rates at second codon positions that may represent the effects of positive selection.},

abstract = {The ability to determine the gene expression pattern in low quantities of cells or single cells is important for resolving a variety of problems in many biological disciplines. A robust description of the expression signature of a single cell requires determination of the full-length sequence of the expressed mRNAs in the cell, yet existing methods have either 3' biased or variable transcript representation. Here, we report our protocols for the amplification and high-throughput sequencing of very small amounts of RNA for sequencing using procedures of either semirandom primed PCR or phi29 DNA polymerase-based DNA amplification, for the cDNA generated with oligo-dT and/or random oligonucleotide primers. Unlike existing methods, these protocols produce relatively uniformly distributed sequences covering the full length of almost all transcripts independent of their sizes, from 1,000 to 10 cells, and even with single cells. Both protocols produced satisfactory detection/coverage of the abundant mRNAs from a single K562 erythroleukemic cell or a single dorsal root ganglion neuron. The phi29-based method produces long products with less noise, uses an isothermal reaction, and is simple to practice. The semirandom primed PCR procedure is more sensitive and reproducible at low transcript levels or with low quantities of cells. These methods provide tools for mRNA sequencing or RNA sequencing when only low quantities of cells, a single cell, or even degraded RNA are available for profiling.},

abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels play important roles in regulating insulin secretion, controlling vascular tone, and protecting cells against metabolic stresses. K(ATP) channels are heterooctamers of four pore-forming inwardly rectifying (Kir6.2) subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. K(ATP) channels containing SUR1 (e.g. pancreatic) and SUR2A (e.g. cardiac) display distinct metabolic sensitivities and pharmacological profiles. The reported expression of both SUR1 and SUR2 together with Kir6.2 in some cells raises the possibility that heteromeric channels containing both SUR subtypes might exist. To test whether SUR1 can coassemble with SUR2A to form functional K(ATP) channels, we made tandem constructs by fusing SUR to either a wild-type (WT) or a mutant N160D Kir6.2 subunit. The latter mutation greatly increases the sensitivity of K(ATP) channels to block by intracellular spermine. We expressed, individually and in combinations, tandem constructs SUR1-Kir6.2 (S1-WT), SUR1-Kir6.2[N160D] (S1-ND), and SUR2A-Kir6.2[N160D] (S2-ND) in Xenopus oocytes, and studied the voltage dependence of spermine block in inside-out macropatches over a range of spermine concentrations and RNA mixing ratios. Each tandem construct expressed alone supported macroscopic K(+) currents with pharmacological properties indistinguishable from those of the respective native channel types. Spermine sensitivity was low for S1-WT but high for S1-ND and S2-ND. Coexpression of S1-WT and S1-ND generated current components with intermediate spermine sensitivities indicating the presence of channel populations containing both types of Kir subunits at all possible stoichiometries. The relative abundances of these populations, determined by global fitting over a range of conditions, followed binomial statistics, suggesting that WT and N160D Kir6.2 subunits coassemble indiscriminately. Coexpression of S1-WT with S2-ND also yielded current components with intermediate spermine sensitivities, suggesting that SUR1 and SUR2A randomly coassemble into functional K(ATP) channels. Further pharmacological characterization confirmed coassembly of not only S1-WT and S2-ND, but also of coexpressed free SUR1, SUR2A, and Kir6.2 into functional heteromeric channels.},

abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play pivotal physiological roles in substrate transport across membranes, and defective assembly of these proteins can cause severe disease associated with improper drug or ion flux. The yeast protein Yor1p is a useful model to study the biogenesis of ABC transporters; deletion of a phenylalanine residue in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) causes misassembly and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the resulting protein Yor1p- $\Delta$F670, similar to the predominant disease-causing allele in humans, CFTR- $\Delta$F508. Here we describe two novel Yor1p mutants, G278R and I1084P, which fail to assemble and traffic similar to Yor1p- $\Delta$F670. These mutations are located in the two intracellular loops (ICLs) that interface directly with NBD1, and thus disrupt a functionally important structural module. We isolated two second-site mutations, F270S and R1168M, that partially correct the folding injuries associated with the G278R, I1084P and $\Delta$F670 mutants and that reinstate their trafficking. The position of both corrective mutations at the cytoplasmic face of a transmembrane helix suggests that they restore biogenesis by influencing the behavior of the transmembrane domains rather than by direct restoration of the ICL1-ICL4-NBD1 structural module. Given the conserved topology of many ABC transporters, our findings provide new understanding of functionally important inter-domain interactions and suggest new potential avenues for correcting folding defects caused by abrogation of those domain interfaces.},

abstract = {Rat neocortical slices express spontaneous epileptiform activity after incubation with GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline (BIC, 20 $\mu$M), with potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 50 $\mu$M) or in Mg2+-free medium (LMG). Various parameters of spontaneous and evoked epileptiform discharges and their pharmacological sensitivity were analysed using extracellular field potential recordings in this comparative in vitro study. All types of convulsant solution induced spontaneous epileptiform activity, however, the analysed parameters showed that characteristics of epileptiform discharges are rather different in the three models. The longest duration of discharges was recorded in LMG, while the highest frequency of spontaneous events was detected in 4-AP. The epileptiform field responses elicited by electrical stimulation appeared in an all-or-none manner in BIC. On the contrary, in 4-AP and in LMG the amplitude of the responses increased gradually with increasing stimulation intensities. The NMDA receptor antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV, 25 $\mu$M) abolished the LMG induced spontaneous epileptiform activity and significantly reduced the frequency of the epileptiform discharges in BIC and 4-AP. Blocking the AMPA type of glutamate transmission with 1-(aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466, 40 $\mu$M) rapidly abolished BIC-induced spontaneous epileptiform activity and caused a significant decrease in the frequency of 4-AP induced spontaneous epileptiform discharges. However, it had only a weak effect on the LMG-induced epileptiform activity. We conclude that the contribution of NMDA and AMPA types of glutamate receptors to the development and maintenance of epileptiform activity in cortical cell assemblies is different in the three models. There are significant alterations in contribution of NMDA and AMPA types of glutamate receptors to the above-mentioned processes in the different convulsants. In BIC the synchronisation is mainly due to the altered network properties, namely inhibition is reduced in the local circuits. Although inhibition is reduced in the local circuits, the AMPA receptor antagonist relatively easily blocked the synchronised excitation. In 4-AP, and especially in LMG, changes in the membrane characteristics of neurones play a crucial role in the increased excitability. In this case the AMPA antagonist was less effective. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors in cardiac ventricular myocytes activates a strong chloride ion conductance as a result of phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). This Cl- conductance, which is time- and voltage-independent, counters the tendency of the simultaneously enhanced Ca2+ channel current to prolong the ventricular action potential. Using inside-out giant patches excised from guinea-pig myocytes, we show here that phosphorylation by the PKA catalytic subunit plus Mg-ATP elicits discrete Cl- channel currents. In almost symmetrical Cl- solutions (approximately 150 mM), unitary current amplitude scales with membrane potential, and reverses sign near 0 mV, to yield a single channel conductance of approximately 12 pS. Opening of the phosphorylated channels requires hydrolysable nucleoside triphosphate, indicating that phosphorylation by PKA is necessary, but not sufficient, for channel activation. The properties of these PKA-regulated cardiac Cl- channels are very similar, if not identical, to those of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the epithelial cell Cl- channel whose regulation is defective in patients with cystic fibrosis. The full cardiological impact of these Cl- channels and of their possible malfunction in patients with cystic fibrosis remains to be determined.},

abstract = {Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded RNA molecules of 20-23 nucleotide (nt) length that control gene expression in many cellular processes. These molecules typically reduce the stability of mRNAs, including those of genes that mediate processes in tumorigenesis, such as inflammation, cell cycle regulation, stress response, differentiation, apoptosis and invasion. miRNA targeting is mostly achieved through specific base-pairing interactions between the 5' end ('seed' region) of the miRNA and sites within coding and untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs; target sites in the 3' UTR lead to more effective mRNA destabilization. Since miRNAs frequently target hundreds of mRNAs, miRNA regulatory pathways are complex. To provide a critical overview of miRNA dysregulation in cancer, we first discuss the methods currently available for studying the role of miRNAs in cancer and then review miRNA genomic organization, biogenesis and mechanism of target recognition, examining how these processes are altered in tumorigenesis. Given the critical role miRNAs play in tumorigenesis processes and their disease-specific expression, they hold potential as therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers.},

abstract = {Markov state models of molecular kinetics (MSMs), in which the long-time statistical dynamics of a molecule is approximated by a Markov chain on a discrete partition of configuration space, have seen widespread use in recent years. This approach has many appealing characteristics compared to straightforward molecular dynamics simulation and analysis, including the potential to mitigate the sampling problem by extracting long-time kinetic information from short trajectories and the ability to straightforwardly calculate expectation values and statistical uncertainties of various stationary and dynamical molecular observables. In this paper, we summarize the current state of the art in generation and validation of MSMs and give some important new results. We describe an upper bound for the approximation error made by modeling molecular dynamics with a MSM and we show that this error can be made arbitrarily small with surprisingly little effort. In contrast to previous practice, it becomes clear that the best MSM is not obtained by the most metastable discretization, but the MSM can be much improved if non-metastable states are introduced near the transition states. Moreover, we show that it is not necessary to resolve all slow processes by the state space partitioning, but individual dynamical processes of interest can be resolved separately. We also present an efficient estimator for reversible transition matrices and a robust test to validate that a MSM reproduces the kinetics of the molecular dynamics data.},

abstract = {The protein-folding problem was first posed about one half-century ago. The term refers to three broad questions: (i) What is the physical code by which an amino acid sequence dictates a protein's native structure? (ii) How can proteins fold so fast? (iii) Can we devise a computer algorithm to predict protein structures from their sequences? We review progress on these problems. In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was thought possible in the early days. What began as three questions of basic science one half-century ago has now grown into the full-fledged research field of protein physical science.},

Elucidating closely related miRNAs and mRNAs can be an essential first step towards the discovery of their combinatorial effects on different cellular states. Here, we propose a probabilistic learning method to identify synergistic miRNAs involving regulation of their condition-specific target genes (mRNAs) from multiple information sources, i.e. computationally predicted target genes of miRNAs and their respective expression profiles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We used data sets consisting of miRNA-target gene binding information and expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs on human cancer samples. Our method allowed us to detect functionally correlated miRNA-mRNA modules involved in specific biological processes from multiple data sources by using a balanced fitness function and efficient searching over multiple populations. The proposed algorithm found two miRNA-mRNA modules, highly correlated with respect to their expression and biological function. Moreover, the mRNAs included in the same module showed much higher correlations when the related miRNAs were highly expressed, demonstrating our method's ability for finding coherent miRNA-mRNA modules. Most members of these modules have been reported to be closely related with cancer. Consequently, our method can provide a primary source of miRNA and target sets presumed to constitute closely related parts of gene regulatory pathways.},

A unified energetic and kinematic framework in the Rosetta program allows a wide range of molecular modeling problems, from fibril structure prediction to RNA folding to the design of new protein interfaces, to be readily investigated and highlights areas for improvement. The methodology enables the creation of novel molecules with useful functions and holds promise for accelerating experimental structural inference.

abstract = {Most methods for detecting Darwinian natural selection at the molecular level rely on estimating the rates or numbers of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes in an alignment of protein-coding DNA sequences. In some of these methods, the nonsynonymous rate of substitution is allowed to vary across the sequence, permitting the identification of single amino acid positions that are under positive natural selection. However, it is unclear which probability distribution should be used to describe how the nonsynonymous rate of substitution varies across the sequence. One widely used solution is to model variation in the nonsynonymous rate across the sequence as a mixture of several discrete or continuous probability distributions. Unfortunately, there is little population genetics theory to inform us of the appropriate probability distribution for among-site variation in the nonsynonymous rate of substitution. Here, we describe an approach to modeling variation in the nonsynonymous rate of substitution by using a Dirichlet process mixture model. The Dirichlet process allows there to be a countably infinite number of nonsynonymous rate classes and is very flexible in accommodating different potential distributions for the nonsynonymous rate of substitution. We implemented the model in a fully Bayesian approach, with all parameters of the model considered as random variables.},

This type of contamination is problem-atic for downstream analyses as it will introduce a bias towards the popula-tion to which the contaminating individuals belong. Quantifying the extent of contamination is a crucial step as it allows researchers to account for pos-sible biases that may arise in downstream genetic analyses. Here, we present an MCMC algorithm to co-estimate the contamination rate, sequencing er-ror rate and demographic parameters -including drift times and admixture rates -for an ancient nuclear genome obtained from human remains, when the putative contaminating DNA comes from present-day humans. We assume we have a large panel representing the putative contaminating population (e.g. European, East Asian or African). The method is implemented in a C++ program called 'Demographic Inference with Contamination and Error' (DICE). The program can also be used to determine the most likely popu-lation to which the contaminant DNA belongs. We applied it to simulations and Neanderthal genome data, and we recover accurate estimates of all pa-rameters, even when the average sequencing coverage is low (0.5X) and the per-read contamination rate is high (25{\%}).},

We evaluated an amplicon-based method for the analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes on the Roche 454 GS-FLX sequencer, to identify disease-causing mutations in breast and/or ovarian cancer patients. A first evaluation relied on the analysis of DNA fragments containing known mutations. Secondly, the entire coding regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were interrogated in more than 400 patient samples, using a multiplex PCR-based assay. Variants were filtered on the basis of their frequency (20{\%}) and sequencing depth ({\textgreater}25??). Special attention was given to sequencing accuracy in homopolymers. In the initial evaluation, all known heterozygous mutations were detected. The percentage of mutant reads ranged from 22{\%} to 62{\%}. For the multiplex assay, 95{\%} sensitivity and 91{\%} specificity were obtained. In addition, we were able to reliably distinguish mutations from noise through the analysis of the raw signal intensities in homopolymers. This work presents an evaluation of the next-generation sequencing for use in diagnostics, based on a relatively high number of samples and experiments. We anticipate that the technique would further improve, and would allow reducing the costs per analysis and the turn-around time, to benefit patients who undergo BRCA molecular testing. ?? 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.},

We then screened, using three different versions of the capture set, a large series of 708 consecutive patients. We detected in these patients 69 germline deleterious alterations within BRCA1 and BRCA2, and 4 TP53 mutations in 468 patients also tested for this gene.

Users may smoothly switch between the two components in the pipeline, facilitating web-based operations on a supercomputer for high-throughput data analysis. Moreover, public NGS reads of the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive located on the same supercomputer can be imported into the pipeline through the input of only an accession number.

Unfortunately, lots of structural errors, bad labels, missing atoms, falsely identified chains and groups make dificult the automated processing of this treasury of structural biological data. RESULTS: After we performed a rigorous re-structuring of the whole PDB on graph-theoretical basis, we created the RS-PDB (Rich-Structure PDB) database. Using this cleaned and repaired database, we defined simplicial complexes on the heavy-atoms of the PDB, and analyzed the tetrahedra for geometric properties. CONCLUSION: We have found surprisingly characteristic differences between simplices with atomic vertices of different types, and between the atomic neighborhoods--described also by simplices--of different ligand atoms in proteins.},

abstract = {Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) after robust stimulation is necessary for vesicle pool replenishment in secretory cells. Here we studied the contribution of a prominent downstream PKC target, Munc18-1, to this process in bovine chromaffin cells. In these cells, both activation of endogenous PKC and overexpressing of Munc18-1 promote vesicle pool replenishment after an extensive stimulation. In order to study the physiological relevance of PKC-dependent Munc18-1 phosphorylation, we generated two Munc18-1 phospho-mutants; one that mimics a constitutively PKC-phosphorylated Munc18-1 (i.e. a phosphomimetic mutant; Munc18-1S313D) and a second that cannot be PKC-phosphorylated (Munc18-13A). Overexpression of Munc18-13A caused a significant decrease in vesicle pool replenishment following a depleting stimulation, while Munc18-1S313D caused a significant increase in vesicle pool replenishment. These findings suggested that the phosphorylation of Munc18-1 by PKC potentiates vesicle pool replenishment. This hypothesis was further strengthened by the finding that overexpression of wild type Munc18-1 in the presence of a PKC inhibitor caused a significant reduction in vesicle pool replenishment, similar to that observed with Munc18-13A. Moreover, overexpression of Munc18-1S313D in the presence of the PKC inhibitor partly alleviated this attenuation, elucidating Munc18-1's unique contribution to vesicle pool replenishment. Finally, we demonstrate that Munc18-1 promotes vesicle docking in a phosphorylation-independent manner. This is deduced from the findings that both the wild type and the two Munc18-1 phospho-mutants enhanced docking to the same extent in bovine chromaffin cells. We conclude that Munc18-1 facilitates docking in a PKC phosphorylation-independent manner, and that its phosphorylation by PKC potentiates vesicle pool replenishment following a depleting stimulation, at a post-docking stage. ?? 2006 IBRO.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

abstract = {Although previous studies have documented a bottleneck in the transmission of mtDNA genomes from mothers to offspring, several aspects remain unclear, including the size and nature of the bottleneck. Here, we analyze the dynamics of mtDNA heteroplasmy transmission in the Genomes of the Netherlands (GoNL) data, which consists of complete mtDNA genome sequences from 228 trios, eight dizygotic (DZ) twin quartets, and 10 monozygotic (MZ) twin quartets. Using a minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold of 2{\%}, we identified 189 heteroplasmies in the trio mothers, of which 59{\%} were transmitted to offspring, and 159 heteroplasmies in the trio offspring, of which 70{\%} were inherited from the mothers. MZ twin pairs exhibited greater similarity in MAF at heteroplasmic sites than DZ twin pairs, suggesting that the heteroplasmy MAF in the oocyte is the major determinant of the heteroplasmy MAF in the offspring. We used a likelihood method to estimate the effective number of mtDNA genomes transmitted to offspring under different bottleneck models; a variable bottleneck size model provided the best fit to the data, with an estimated mean of nine individual mtDNA genomes transmitted. We also found evidence for negative selection during transmission against novel heteroplasmies (in which the minor allele has never been observed in polymorphism data). These novel heteroplasmies are enhanced for tRNA and rRNA genes, and mutations associated with mtDNA diseases frequently occur in these genes. Our results thus suggest that the female germ line is able to recognize and select against deleterious heteroplasmies.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an essential prerequisite for many sequence analysis methods and valuable tool itself for describing relationships between protein sequences. Since the success of the sequence analysis is highly dependent on the reliability of alignments, measures for assessing the quality of alignments are highly requisite. RESULTS: We present a statistical model-based alignment quality score. Unlike other quality scores, it does not require several parallel alignments for the same set of sequences or additional structural information. Our quality score is based on measuring the conservation level of reference alignments in Homstrad. Reference sequences were realigned with the Mafft, Muscle and Probcons alignment programs, and a sum-of-pairs (SP) score was used to measure the quality of the realignments. Statistical modelling of the SP score as a function of conservation level and other alignment characteristics makes it possible to predict the SP score for any global MSA. The predicted SP scores are highly correlated with the correct SP scores, when tested on the Homstrad and SABmark databases. The results are comparable to that of multiple overlap score (MOS) and better than those of normalized mean distance (NorMD) and normalized iRMSD (NiRMSD) alignment quality criteria. Furthermore, the predicted SP score is able to detect alignments with badly aligned or unrelated sequences. AVAILABILITY: The method is freely available at http://www.mtt.fi/AlignmentQuality/.},

We have developed a web-based tool, PATH-SCAN, which annotates individual genomes and exomes for ClinVar designated pathogenic variants found within the genes from the ACMG guidelines. Because mutations in these genes predispose individuals to conditions with actionable outcomes, our tool will allow individuals or researchers to identify potential risk variants in order to consult physicians or genetic counselors for further evaluation. Moreover, our tool allows individuals to anonymously submit their pathogenic burden, so that we can crowd source the collection of quantitative information regarding the frequency of these variants. We tested our tool on 1092 publicly available genomes from the 1000 Genomes project, 163 genomes from the Personal Genome Project, and 15 genomes from a clinical genome sequencing research project.

We have integrated molecular profiling results of several "omics" data types to determine the most reliable prognostic biomarkers for relapse in CRC using data from 40 stage I and II CRC patients.

The data types were integrated using multi-step analytical approach with consecutive elimination of redundant molecular features. For each data type a systems biology analysis was performed to identify pathways biological processes and disease categories most affected in relapse. The biomarkers detected in tumors urine and blood of patients indicated a strong association with immune processes including aberrant regulation of T-cell and B-cell activation that could lead to overall differences in lymphocyte recruitment for tumor infiltration and markers indicating likelihood of future relapse. The immune response was the biologically most coherent signature that emerged from our analyses among several other biological processes and corroborates other studies showing a strong immune response in patients less likely to relapse.},

abstract = {Community network analysis derived from molecular dynamics simulations is used to identify and compare the signaling pathways in a bacterial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS):tRNA(Glu) and an archaeal leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS):tRNA(Leu) complex. Although the 2 class I synthetases have remarkably different interactions with their cognate tRNAs, the allosteric networks for charging tRNA with the correct amino acid display considerable similarities. A dynamic contact map defines the edges connecting nodes (amino acids and nucleotides) in the physical network whose overall topology is presented as a network of communities, local substructures that are highly intraconnected, but loosely interconnected. Whereas nodes within a single community can communicate through many alternate pathways, the communication between monomers in different communities has to take place through a smaller number of critical edges or interactions. Consistent with this analysis, there are a large number of suboptimal paths that can be used for communication between the identity elements on the tRNAs and the catalytic site in the aaRS:tRNA complexes. Residues and nucleotides in the majority of pathways for intercommunity signal transmission are evolutionarily conserved and are predicted to be important for allosteric signaling. The same monomers are also found in a majority of the suboptimal paths. Modifying these residues or nucleotides has a large effect on the communication pathways in the protein:RNA complex consistent with kinetic data.},

In order to identify miRNAs and to assess their expression patterns, we sequenced over 250 small RNA libraries from 26 different organ systems and cell types of human and rodents, enriched in neuronal as well as normal and malignant hematopoietic cells and tissues. We present expression profiles derived from clone count data and provide novel computational tools for their analysis. Unexpectedly, a relatively small set of miRNAs, many of which are ubiquitously expressed, account for most of the difference in miRNA profiles between cell lineages and tissues. This broad survey also provides detailed and accurate information about mature sequences, precursors, genome locations, maturation processes, inferred transcriptional units and conservation patterns. We also propose a subclassification scheme for miRNAs for assisting future experimental and computational functional analyses.},

abstract = {The third variable loop (V3) of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope is a principal determinant of antibody neutralization and progression to AIDS. Although it is undoubtedly an important target for vaccine research, extensive genetic variation in V3 remains an obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine. Comparative methods that exploit the abundance of sequence data can detect interactions between residues of rapidly evolving proteins such as the HIV-1 envelope, revealing biological constraints on their variability. However, previous studies have relied implicitly on two biologically unrealistic assumptions: (1) that founder effects in the evolutionary history of the sequences can be ignored, and; (2) that statistical associations between residues occur exclusively in pairs. We show that comparative methods that neglect the evolutionary history of extant sequences are susceptible to a high rate of false positives (20{\%}-40{\%}). Therefore, we propose a new method to detect interactions that relaxes both of these assumptions. First, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of extant sequences by maximum likelihood, shifting focus from extant sequence variation to the underlying substitution events. Second, we analyze the joint distribution of substitution events among positions in the sequence as a Bayesian graphical model, in which each branch in the phylogeny is a unit of observation. We perform extensive validation of our models using both simulations and a control case of known interactions in HIV-1 protease, and apply this method to detect interactions within V3 from a sample of 1,154 HIV-1 envelope sequences. Our method greatly reduces the number of false positives due to founder effects, while capturing several higher-order interactions among V3 residues. By mapping these interactions to a structural model of the V3 loop, we find that the loop is stratified into distinct evolutionary clusters. We extend our model to detect interactions between the V3 and C4 domains of the HIV-1 envelope, and account for the uncertainty in mapping substitutions to the tree with a parametric bootstrap.},

The vesicular soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein synaptobrevin 2 and the plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin 1 and synaptosomal protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) are essential for calcium-triggered exocytosis. However, the link between calcium triggering and SNARE function remains elusive. Here we describe mutations in two sites on the surface of the SNARE complex formed by acidic and hydrophilic residues of SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin 2, which were found to coordinate divalent cations in the neuronal SNARE complex crystal structure. By reducing the net charge of the site in SNAP-25 we identify a mutation that interferes with calcium triggering of exocytosis when overexpressed in chromaffin cells. Exocytosis was elicited by photorelease of calcium from a calcium cage and evaluated by using patch-clamp capacitance measurements at millisecond time resolution. We present a method for monitoring the dependence of exocytotic rate upon calcium concentration at the release site and demonstrate that the mutation decreased the steepness of this relationship, indicating that the number of sequential calcium-binding steps preceding exocytosis is reduced by one. We conclude that the SNARE complex is linked directly to calcium triggering of exocytosis, most likely in a complex with auxiliary proteins.},

The leading groups also demonstrated the ability to consistently improve both backbone and side chain positioning, while other groups reliably enhanced other aspects of protein physicality. The top-ranked group succeeded in improving the backbone conformation in almost 90{\%} of targets, suggesting a strategy that for the first time in CASP refinement is successful in a clear majority of cases. A number of issues remain unsolved: the majority of groups still fail to improve the quality of the starting models; even successful groups are only able to make modest improvements; and no prediction is more similar to the native structure than to the starting model. Successful refinement attempts also often go unrecognized, as suggested by the relatively larger improvements when predictions not submitted as model 1 are also considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene expression genetic studies in human tissues and cells identify cis- and trans-acting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). These eQTLs provide insights into regulatory mechanisms underlying disease risk. However, few studies systematically characterized eQTL results across cell and tissues types. We synthesized eQTL results from {\textgreater}50 datasets, including new primary data from human brain, peripheral plaque and kidney samples, in order to discover features of human eQTLs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We find a substantial number of robust cis-eQTLs and far fewer trans-eQTLs consistent across tissues. Analysis of 45 full human GWAS scans indicates eQTLs are enriched overall, and above nSNPs, among positive statistical signals in genetic mapping studies, and account for a significant fraction of the strongest human trait effects. Expression QTLs are enriched for gene centricity, higher population allele frequencies, in housekeeping genes, and for coincidence with regulatory features, though there is little evidence of 5' or 3' positional bias. Several regulatory categories are not enriched including microRNAs and their predicted binding sites and long, intergenic non-coding RNAs. Among the most tissue-ubiquitous cis-eQTLs, there is enrichment for genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and mitochondrial function, suggesting these eQTLs may have adaptive origins. Several strong eQTLs (CDK5RAP2, NBPFs) coincide with regions of reported human lineage selection. The intersection of new kidney and plaque eQTLs with related GWAS suggest possible gene prioritization. For example, butyrophilins are now linked to arterial pathogenesis via multiple genetic and expression studies. Expression QTL and GWAS results are made available as a community resource through the NHLBI GRASP database [http://apps.nhlbi.nih.gov/grasp/].$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Expression QTLs inform the interpretation of human trait variability, and may account for a greater fraction of phenotypic variability than protein-coding variants. The synthesis of available tissue eQTL data highlights many strong cis-eQTLs that may have important biologic roles and could serve as positive controls in future studies. Our results indicate some strong tissue-ubiquitous eQTLs may have adaptive origins in humans. Efforts to expand the genetic, splicing and tissue coverage of known eQTLs will provide further insights into human gene regulation.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs, or miRNAs, post-transcriptionally repress the expression of protein-coding genes. The human genome encodes over 1000 miRNA genes that collectively target the majority of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Base pairing of the so-called miRNA 'seed' region with mRNAs identifies many thousands of putative targets. Evaluating the strength of the resulting mRNA repression remains challenging, but is essential for a biologically informative ranking of potential miRNA targets. To address these challenges, predictors may use thermodynamic, evolutionary, probabilistic or sequence-based features. We developed an open-source software library, miRmap, which for the first time comprehensively covers all four approaches using 11 predictor features, 3 of which are novel. This allowed us to examine feature correlations and to compare their predictive power in an unbiased way using high-throughput experimental data from immunopurification, transcriptomics, proteomics and polysome fractionation experiments. Overall, target site accessibility appears to be the most predictive feature. Our novel feature based on PhyloP, which evaluates the significance of negative selection, is the best performing predictor in the evolutionary category. We combined all the features into an integrated model that almost doubles the predictive power of TargetScan. miRmap is freely available from http://cegg.unige.ch/mirmap.},

abstract = {Calcium-triggered exocytosis of neurotransmitter or hormone-filled vesicles has developed as the main mechanism for cell-to-cell communication in animals. Consequently, in the course of evolution this form of exocytosis has been optimized for speed. Since many of the maturation processes of vesicles are intrinsically slow, the solution has been to develop a pool of vesicles that are fully matured and can be fused very rapidly upon stimulation. Vesicles in this readily releasable pool are characterized by very low release rate constants at the resting cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) and very high release rate constants at stimulated [Ca2+]i. Here I review the kinetic and molecular requirements for the existence of such a pool of vesicles, focusing on chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. I discuss how the use of assay methods with different time resolution may lead to fundamentally different conclusions about the role of proteins in exocytosis. Finally, I review recent evidence that the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, formed between proteins residing in the vesicle and the plasma membrane, is involved in formation and stabilization of the readily releasable vesicle pool, whereas synaptotagmin, a Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding vesicular protein, is involved in setting the Ca2+ dependence of the fusion process itself. Future studies are likely to focus on the interaction between these two classes of proteins.},

abstract = {Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) constitutes a key event in the upregulation of secretory strength in neurons and neurosecretory cells during extensive stimulation, presumably by speeding up vesicle supply. However, the molecular targets and their mode of action remain elusive. We studied the only PKC-dependent phosphorylation site in the neuronal soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, Ser(187), in synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25). This phosphorylation site is located within the negatively charged C-terminal end of SNAP-25, which has been shown to be of critical importance in calcium-triggered exocytosis. We combined mutational studies that used overexpression in chromaffin cells with capacitance measurements and flash photolysis of caged calcium, allowing for high time resolution during both the stimulation and measurement of exocytosis. Overexpression of mutants simulating the phosphorylated form of Ser(187) accelerated vesicle recruitment after the emptying of the releasable vesicle pools. Overexpression of mutants simulating the nonphosphorylated form, or block of PKC, impaired the refilling of the vesicle pools to similar extents. Biochemical studies verified the phosphorylation of a subpopulation of SNAP-25 after elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations. Some of the mutations led to a moderately decreased fast exocytotic burst component, which did not seem to be associated with the phosphorylation state of SNAP-25. Thus the C terminus of SNAP-25 plays a role for both fast exocytosis triggering and vesicle recruitment, and the latter process is regulated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Cis-regulatory elements such as transcription factor (TF) binding sites can be identified genome-wide, but it remains far more challenging to pinpoint genetic variants affecting TF binding. Here, we introduce a pooling-based approach to mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for molecular-level traits. Applying this to five TFs and a histone modification, we mapped thousands of cis-acting QTLs, with over 25-fold lower cost compared to standard QTL mapping. We found that single genetic variants frequently affect binding of multiple TFs, and CTCF can recruit all five TFs to its binding sites. These QTLs often affect local chromatin and transcription but can also influence long-range chromosomal contacts, demonstrating a role for natural genetic variation in chromosomal architecture. Thousands of these QTLs have been implicated in genome-wide association studies, providing candidate molecular mechanisms for many disease risk loci and suggesting that TF binding variation may underlie a large fraction of human phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {By characterizing the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to build a resource to help to understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98{\%} of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1{\%} in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Illumina's sequencing platforms are currently the most utilised sequencing systems worldwide. The technology has rapidly evolved over recent years and provides high throughput at low costs with increasing read-lengths and true paired-end reads. However, data from any sequencing technology contains noise and our understanding of the peculiarities and sequencing errors encountered in Illumina data has lagged behind this rapid development.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We conducted a systematic investigation of errors and biases in Illumina data based on the largest collection of in vitro metagenomic data sets to date. We evaluated the Genome Analyzer II, HiSeq and MiSeq and tested state-of-the-art low input library preparation methods. Analysing in vitro metagenomic sequencing data allowed us to determine biases directly associated with the actual sequencing process. The position- and nucleotide-specific analysis revealed a substantial bias related to motifs (3mers preceding errors) ending in "GG". On average the top three motifs were linked to 16 {\%} of all substitution errors. Furthermore, a preferential incorporation of ddGTPs was recorded. We hypothesise that all of these biases are related to the engineered polymerase and ddNTPs which are intrinsic to any sequencing-by-synthesis method. We show that quality-score-based error removal strategies can on average remove 69 {\%} of the substitution errors - however, the motif-bias remains.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Single-nucleotide polymorphism changes in bacterial genomes can cause significant changes in phenotype, including antibiotic resistance and virulence, detecting them within metagenomes is therefore vital. Current error removal techniques are not designed to target the peculiarities encountered in Illumina sequencing data and other sequencing-by-synthesis methods, causing biases to persist and potentially affect any conclusions drawn from the data. In order to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches we need to be able to identify systematic sequencing errors and distinguish these errors from true genetic variation.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been leading the genetic study of human disease into an era of unprecedented productivity. Many bioinformatics pipelines have been developed to call variants from NGS data. The performance of these pipelines depends crucially on the variant caller used and on the calling strategies implemented. We studied the performance of four prevailing callers, SAMtools, GATK, glftools and Atlas2, using single-sample and multiple-sample variant-calling strategies. Using the same aligner, BWA, we built four single-sample and three multiple-sample calling pipelines and applied the pipelines to whole exome sequencing data taken from 20 individuals. We obtained genotypes generated by Illumina Infinium HumanExome v1.1 Beadchip for validation analysis and then used Sanger sequencing as a "gold-standard" method to resolve discrepancies for selected regions of high discordance. Finally, we compared the sensitivity of three of the single-sample calling pipelines using known simulated whole genome sequence data as a gold standard. Overall, for single-sample calling, the called variants were highly consistent across callers and the pairwise overlapping rate was about 0.9. Compared with other callers, GATK had the highest rediscovery rate (0.9969) and specificity (0.99996), and the Ti/Tv ratio out of GATK was closest to the expected value of 3.02. Multiple-sample calling increased the sensitivity. Results from the simulated data suggested that GATK outperformed SAMtools and glfSingle in sensitivity, especially for low coverage data. Further, for the selected discrepant regions evaluated by Sanger sequencing, variant genotypes called by exome sequencing versus the exome array were more accurate, although the average variant sensitivity and overall genotype consistency rate were as high as 95.87{\%} and 99.82{\%}, respectively. In conclusion, GATK showed several advantages over other variant callers for general purpose NGS analyses. The GATK pipelines we developed perform very well.},

abstract = {Existing techniques to reconstruct tree models of progression for accumulative processes, such as cancer, seek to estimate causation by combining correlation and a frequentist notion of temporal priority. In this paper, we define a novel theoretical framework called CAPRESE (CAncer PRogression Extraction with Single Edges) to reconstruct such models based on the notion of probabilistic causation defined by Suppes. We consider a general reconstruction setting complicated by the presence of noise in the data due to biological variation, as well as experimental or measurement errors. To improve tolerance to noise we define and use a shrinkage-like estimator. We prove the correctness of our algorithm by showing asymptotic convergence to the correct tree under mild constraints on the level of noise. Moreover, on synthetic data, we show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, that it is efficient even with a relatively small number of samples and that its performance quickly converges to its asymptote as the number of samples increases. For real cancer datasets obtained with different technologies, we highlight biologically significant differences in the progressions inferred with respect to other competing techniques and we also show how to validate conjectured biological relations with progression models.},

abstract = {HIV avoids elimination by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) through the evolution of escape mutations. Although there is mounting evidence that these escape pathways are broadly consistent among individuals with similar human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles, previous population-based studies have been limited by the inability to simultaneously account for HIV codon covariation, linkage disequilibrium among HLA alleles, and the confounding effects of HIV phylogeny when attempting to identify HLA-associated viral evolution. We have developed a statistical model of evolution, called a phylogenetic dependency network, that accounts for these three sources of confounding and identifies the primary sources of selection pressure acting on each HIV codon. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the utility of this approach for identifying sites of HLA-mediated selection pressure and codon evolution as well as the deleterious effects of failing to account for all three sources of confounding. We then apply our approach to a large, clinically-derived dataset of Gag p17 and p24 sequences from a multicenter cohort of 1144 HIV-infected individuals from British Columbia, Canada (predominantly HIV-1 clade B) and Durban, South Africa (predominantly HIV-1 clade C). The resulting phylogenetic dependency network is dense, containing 149 associations between HLA alleles and HIV codons and 1386 associations among HIV codons. These associations include the complete reconstruction of several recently defined escape and compensatory mutation pathways and agree with emerging data on patterns of epitope targeting. The phylogenetic dependency network adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that sites of escape, order of escape, and compensatory mutations are largely consistent even across different clades, although we also identify several differences between clades. As recent case studies have demonstrated, understanding both the complexity and the consistency of immune escape has important implications for CTL-based vaccine design. Phylogenetic dependency networks represent a major step toward systematically expanding our understanding of CTL escape to diverse populations and whole viral genes.},

We analyzed the Dscam mRNA isoforms expressed by different cell types and individual cells. The choice of splice variants expressed is regulated both spatially and temporally. Different subtypes of photoreceptors express broad yet distinctive spectra of Dscam isoforms. Single-cell RT-PCR documented that individual cells express several different Dscam isoforms and allowed an estimation of the diversity that is present. For example, we estimate that each R3/R4 photoreceptor cell expresses 14-50 distinct mRNAs chosen from the spectrum of thousands of splice variants distinctive of its cell type. Thus, the Dscam repertoire of each cell is different from those of its neighbors, providing a potential mechanism for generating unique cell identity in the nervous system and elsewhere.},

abstract = {To meet challenges in terms of throughput and turnaround time, many diagnostic laboratories are shifting from Sanger sequencing to higher throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms. Bearing in mind that the performance and quality criteria expected from NGS in diagnostic or research settings are strikingly different, we have developed an Ion Torrent's PGM-based routine diagnostic procedure for BRCA1/2 sequencing. The procedure was first tested on a training set of 62 control samples, and then blindly validated on 77 samples in parallel with our routine technique. The training set was composed of difficult cases, for example, insertions and/or deletions of various sizes, large-scale rearrangements and, obviously, mutations occurring in homopolymer regions. We also compared two bioinformatic solutions in this diagnostic context, an in-house academic pipeline and the commercially available NextGene software (Softgenetics). NextGene analysis provided higher sensitivity, as four previously undetected single-nucleotide variations were found. Regarding specificity, an average of 1.5 confirmatory Sanger sequencings per patient was needed for complete BRCA1/2 screening. Large-scale rearrangements were identified by two distinct analyses, that is, bioinformatics and fragment analysis with electrophoresis profile comparison. Turnaround time was enhanced, as a series of 30 patients were sequenced by one technician, making the results available for the clinician in 10 working days following blood sampling. BRCA1/2 genes are a good model, representative of the difficulties commonly encountered in diagnostic settings, which is why we believe our findings are of interest for the whole community, and the pipeline described can be adapted by any user of PGM for diagnostic purposes.},

@article{Rodrigue2009,
abstract = {In recent years, molecular evolutionary models formulated as site-interdependent Markovian codon substitution processes have been proposed as means of mechanistically accounting for selective features over long-range evolutionary scales. Under such models, site interdependencies are reflected in the use of a simplified protein tertiary structure representation and predefined statistical potential, which, along with mutational parameters, mediate nonsynonymous rates of substitution; rates of synonymous events are solely mediated by mutational parameters. Although theoretically attractive, the models are computationally challenging, and the methods used to manipulate them still do not allow for quantitative model evaluations in a multiple-sequence context. Here, we describe Markov chain Monte Carlo computational methodologies for sampling parameters from their posterior distribution under site-interdependent codon substitution models within a phylogenetic context and allowing for Bayesian model assessment and ranking. Specifically, the techniques we expound here can form the basis of posterior predictive checking under these models and can be embedded within thermodynamic integration algorithms for computing Bayes factors. We illustrate the methods using two data sets and find that although current forms of site-interdependent models of codon substitution provide an improved fit, they are outperformed by the extended site-independent versions. Altogether, the methodologies described here should enable a quantified contrasting of alternative ways of modeling structural constraints, or other site-interdependent criteria, and establish if such formulations can match (or supplant) site-independent model extensions.},

Yet, given the incompleteness of the interactome and the limited knowledge of disease-associated genes, it is not obvious if the available data have sufficient coverage to map out modules associated with each disease. Here we derive mathematical conditions for the identifiability of disease modules and show that the network-based location of each disease module determines its pathobiological relationship to other diseases. For example, diseases with overlapping network modules show significant coexpression patterns, symptom similarity, and comorbidity, whereas diseases residing in separated network neighborhoods are phenotypically distinct. These tools represent an interactome-based platform to predict molecular commonalities between phenotypically related diseases, even if they do not share primary disease genes. $\backslash$nCopyright {\textcopyright} 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.},

The fast performance is achieved by special preprocessing and expressing the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm in terms of large matrix operations. Matrix eQTL supports additive linear and ANOVA models with covariates, including models with correlated and heteroskedastic errors. The issue of multiple testing is addressed by calculating false discovery rate; this can be done separately for cis- and trans-eQTLs.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory networks show robustness to perturbations. Previous works identified robustness as an emergent property of gene network evolution but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We used a multi-tier modeling approach that integrates molecular sequence and structure information with network architecture and population dynamics. Structural models of transcription factor-DNA complexes are used to estimate relative binding specificities. In this model, mutations in the DNA cause changes on two levels: (a) at the sequence level in individual binding sites (modulating binding specificity), and (b) at the network level (creating and destroying binding sites). We used this model to dissect the underlying mechanisms responsible for the evolution of robustness in gene regulatory networks. Results suggest that in sparse architectures (represented by short promoters), a mixture of local-sequence and network-architecture level changes are exploited. At the local-sequence level, robustness evolves by decreasing the probabilities of both the destruction of existent and generation of new binding sites. Meanwhile, in highly interconnected architectures (represented by long promoters), robustness evolves almost entirely via network level changes, deleting and creating binding sites that modify the network architecture.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mutual information (MI) theory is often applied to predict positional correlations in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) to make possible the analysis of those positions structurally or functionally important in a given fold or protein family. Accurate identification of coevolving positions in protein sequences is difficult due to the high background signal imposed by phylogeny and noise. Several methods have been proposed using MI to identify coevolving amino acids in protein families. RESULTS: After evaluating two current methods, we demonstrate how the use of sequence-weighting techniques to reduce sequence redundancy and low-count corrections to account for small number of observations in limited size sequence families, can significantly improve the predictability of MI. The evaluation is made on large sets of both in silico-generated alignments as well as on biological sequence data. The methods included in the analysis are the APC (average product correction) and RCW (row-column weighting) methods. The best performing method was APC including sequence-weighting and low-count corrections. The use of sequence-permutations to calculate a MI rescaling is shown to significantly improve the prediction accuracy and allows for direct comparison of information values across protein families. Finally, we demonstrate how a lower bound of 400 sequences {\textless}62{\%} identical is needed in an MSA in order to achieve meaningful predictive performances. With our contribution, we achieve a noteworthy improvement on the current procedures to determine coevolution and residue contacts, and we believe that this will have potential impacts on the understanding of protein structure, function and folding.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled high throughput discovery of somatic mutations. Detection depends on experimental design, lab platforms, parameters and analysis algorithms. However, NGS-based somatic mutation detection is prone to erroneous calls, with reported validation rates near 54{\%} and congruence between algorithms less than 50{\%}. Here, we developed an algorithm to assign a single statistic, a false discovery rate (FDR), to each somatic mutation identified by NGS. This FDR confidence value accurately discriminates true mutations from erroneous calls. Using sequencing data generated from triplicate exome profiling of C57BL/6 mice and B16-F10 melanoma cells, we used the existing algorithms GATK, SAMtools and SomaticSNiPer to identify somatic mutations. For each identified mutation, our algorithm assigned an FDR. We selected 139 mutations for validation, including 50 somatic mutations assigned a low FDR (high confidence) and 44 mutations assigned a high FDR (low confidence). All of the high confidence somatic mutations validated (50 of 50), none of the 44 low confidence somatic mutations validated, and 15 of 45 mutations with an intermediate FDR validated. Furthermore, the assignment of a single FDR to individual mutations enables statistical comparisons of lab and computation methodologies, including ROC curves and AUC metrics. Using the HiSeq 2000, single end 50 nt reads from replicates generate the highest confidence somatic mutation call set.},

abstract = {We describe a Bayesian approach for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. First and foremost, we develop a methodology for assessing informative priors needed for learning. Our approach is derived from a set of assumptions made previously as weil as the assumption of likelihood equivalence, which says that data should not help to discriminate network stmctures that represent the same assertions of conditional independence. We show that likelihood equivalence when combined with previously made assumptions implies that the nser's priors for network parameters can be encoded in a single Bayesian network for the next case to be seen--a prior network and a single measure of confidence for that network. Second, using these priors, we show how to compute the relative posterior probabilities of network structures given data. Third, we describe search methods for identifying network structures with high posterior probabilities. We describe polynomial algorithms for finding the highest-scoring network stmctures in the special case where every node has at most k = 1 parent. For the general case (k {\textgreater} 1), which is Np-hard, we review heuristic search algorithms including local search, iterative local search, and simulated annealing. Finally, we describe a methodology for evaluating Bayesian-network learning algorithms, and apply this approach to a comparison of various approaches.},

Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions.

We then carried out whole-exome single-cell sequencing of 90 cells from a JAK2-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm patient. The sequencing data from 58 cells passed our quality control criteria, and these data indicated that this neoplasm represented a monoclonal evolution. We further identified essential thrombocythemia (ET)-related candidate mutations such as SESN2 and NTRK1, which may be involved in neoplasm progression. This pilot study allowed the initial characterization of the disease-related genetic architecture at the single-cell nucleotide level. Further, we established a single-cell sequencing method that opens the way for detailed analyses of a variety of tumor types, including those with high genetic complex between patients.},

RESULTS: In this paper, we apply approaches to localize highly interacting residues and clusters of residues involved in multiple non-local interactions, and test various secondary structure predictions on this separate subset to assess the effect of long-range interactions on the prediction efficiencies. It was found that only a marginal part of the failure of secondary structure predictions results from the presence of long-range interactions. Alternative possibilities are also discussed.},

As expected, clotting follows the same fundamental pattern as has been observed in other vertebrates, even though genes for some clotting factors found in mammals are absent and some others are present in more than one gene copy. All told, 26 different proteins involved in clotting or fibrinolysis were searched against the puffer fish genome. Of these, orthologs were found for 21. Genes for the "contact system" factors (factor XI, factor XII, and prekallikrein) could not be identified. On the other hand, two genes were found for factor IX and four for factor VII. It was evident that not all four factor VII genes are functional, essential active-site residues having been replaced in two of them. A search of the genome of a urochordate, the sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis, did not turn up any genuine orthologs for these 26 factors, although paralogs and/or constituent domains were evident for virtually all of them.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channel contains two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). After phosphorylation of the R domain, ATP interacts with the NBDs to regulate channel activity. To learn how the NBDs regulate channel function, we used the patch-clamp technique to study CFTR and variants which contained site-directed mutations in the conserved Walker A motif lysine residues in either NBD1 (K464A), NBD2 (K1250A and K1250M), or both NBDs simultaneously (K464A/K1250A). Studies in related proteins suggest that such mutations slow the rate of ATP hydrolysis. These mutations did not alter the conductive properties of the channel or the requirement for phosphorylation and ATP to open the channel. However, all mutations decreased open state probability. Mutations in NBD1 decreased the frequency of bursts of activity, whereas mutations in NBD2 and mutations in both NBDs simultaneously prolonged bursts of activity, as well as decreased the frequency of bursts. These results could not be attributed to altered binding of nucleotide because none of the mutants studied had reduced 8-N3ATP binding. These data suggest that the two NBDs have distinct functions in channel gating; ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 initiates a burst of activity, and hydrolysis at NBD2 terminates a burst.},

However, challenges remain in understanding the source and distribution of the reads, modeling the transcript abundance and developing efficient computational methods. In this article, we develop a method to deal with the isoform expression estimation problem. The count of reads falling into a locus on the genome annotated with multiple isoforms is modeled as a Poisson variable. The expression of each individual isoform is estimated by solving a convex optimization problem and statistical inferences about the parameters are obtained from the posterior distribution by importance sampling. Our results show that isoform expression inference in RNA-Seq is possible by employing appropriate statistical methods.},

Utilizing a newly developed Monte Carlo method, we conducted a systematic investigation of how the SCE relates to the size of the protein and how it differs among a protein's X-ray, NMR, and decoy structures. We estimated the SCE for a set of 675 nonhomologous proteins, and observed that there is a significant SCE for both exposed and buried residues for all these proteins-the contribution of buried residues approaches approximately 40{\%} of the overall SCE. Furthermore, the SCE can be quite different for structures with similar compactness or even similar conformations. As a striking example, we found that proteins' X-ray structures appear to pack more "cleverly" than their NMR or decoy counterparts in the sense of retaining higher SCE while achieving comparable compactness, which suggests that the SCE plays an important role in favouring native protein structures. By including a SCE term in a simple free energy function, we can significantly improve the discrimination of native protein structures from decoys.},

They are usually based on machine learning approaches. For the end user it is often problematic to evaluate the true performance and applicability of computational tools as some knowledge about computer science and statistics would be needed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Instructions are given on how to interpret and compare method evaluation results. For systematic method performance analysis is needed established benchmark datasets which contain cases with known outcome, and suitable evaluation measures. The criteria for benchmark datasets are discussed along with their implementation in VariBench, benchmark database for variations. There is no single measure that alone could describe all the aspects of method performance. Predictions of genetic variation effects on DNA, RNA and protein level are important as information about variants can be produced much faster than their disease relevance can be experimentally verified. Therefore numerous prediction tools have been developed, however, systematic analyses of their performance and comparison have just started to emerge.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The end users of prediction tools should be able to understand how evaluation is done and how to interpret the results. Six main performance evaluation measures are introduced. These include sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient. Together with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis they provide a good picture about the performance of methods and allow their objective and quantitative comparison. A checklist of items to look at is provided. Comparisons of methods for missense variant tolerance, protein stability changes due to amino acid substitutions, and effects of variations on mRNA splicing are presented.},

We evaluated an NGS workflow for targeted DNA sequencing for mutation detection. Targeted sequence data of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, generated using a PCR-based, multiplexed NGS approach using the SOLiD 4 (n = 24) and Ion Torrent PGM (n = 20) next-generation sequencers, were evaluated against sequence data obtained by Sanger sequencing. The overall sensitivity for SOLiD and PGM were 97.8{\%} (95{\%} CI = 94.7 to 100.0) and 98.9{\%} (95{\%} CI = 96.8 to 100.0) respectively. The specificity for the SOLiD platform was high, at 100.0{\%} (95{\%} CI = 99.3 to 100.0). PGM correctly identified all 3 indels, but 68 false-positive indels were also called. Equimolar normalization of amplicons was not necessary for successful NGS. Both platforms are highly amenable to scale-up, potentially reducing the reagent cost for BRCA testing to {\textless}US{\$}200. Only 325 ng of DNA per patient is required, with similar coverage and accuracy obtained using DNA derived from peripheral blood or buccal wash samples.

We report that mixed models optimally extract association information from such samples, demonstrating 88{\%} power to rank the true variant as among the top 10 genome-wide with 56{\%} achieving genome-wide significance, a {\textgreater}80{\%} improvement over the other methods, and demonstrate that population isolates have similar power to non-isolate populations for observing variants of known effects. We then used the mixed-model method to reanalyze data for 17 published phenotypes relating to metabolic traits and electrocardiographic measures, along with another 8 previously unreported. We replicate nine genome-wide significant associations with known loci of plasma cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, thyroid stimulating hormone, homocysteine, C-reactive protein and uric acid, with only one detected in the previous analysis of the same traits.

Haplotype phase can be generated through laboratory-based experimental methods, or it can be estimated using computational approaches. We assess the haplotype phasing methods that are available, focusing in particular on statistical methods, and we discuss the practical aspects of their application. We also describe recent developments that may transform this field, particularly the use of identity-by-descent for computational phasing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular mechanisms associated with frequent relapse of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are poorly defined. It is especially unclear how primary tumor clonal heterogeneity contributes to relapse. Here, we explore unique features of B-cell lymphomas - VDJ recombination and somatic hypermutation - to address this question.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We performed high-throughput sequencing of rearranged VDJ junctions in 14 pairs of matched diagnosis-relapse tumors, among which 7 pairs were further characterized by exome sequencing. We identify two distinctive modes of clonal evolution of DLBCL relapse: an early-divergent mode in which clonally related diagnosis and relapse tumors diverged early and developed in parallel; and a late-divergent mode in which relapse tumors developed directly from diagnosis tumors with minor divergence. By examining mutation patterns in the context of phylogenetic information provided by VDJ junctions, we identified mutations in epigenetic modifiers such as KMT2D as potential early driving events in lymphomagenesis and immune escape alterations as relapse-associated events.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our study for the first time provides important evidence that DLBCL relapse may result from multiple, distinct tumor evolutionary mechanisms, providing rationale for therapies for each mechanism. Moreover, this study highlights the urgent need to understand the driving roles of epigenetic modifier mutations in lymphomagenesis, and immune surveillance factor genetic lesions in relapse.},

Variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA regulatory regions might result in altered protein levels and disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim at identifying genomic regions that contain variants associated with disease, but lack tools for finding causative variants. We present a computational tool that can help identifying SNPs associated with diseases, by focusing on SNPs affecting miRNA-regulation of genes. The tool predicts the effects of SNPs in miRNA target sites and uses linkage disequilibrium to map these miRNA-related variants to SNPs of interest in GWAS. We compared our predicted SNP effects in miRNA target sites with measured SNP effects from allelic imbalance sequencing. Our predictions fit measured effects better than effects based on differences in free energy or differences of TargetScan context scores. We also used our tool to analyse data from published breast cancer and Parkinson's disease GWAS and significant trait-associated SNPs from the NHGRI GWAS Catalog. A database of predicted SNP effects is available at http://www.bigr.medisin.ntnu.no/mirsnpscore/. The database is based on haplotype data from the CEU HapMap population and miRNAs from miRBase 16.0.},

Analysis of smallRNA-Seq data to gather biologically relevant information, i.e. detection and differential expression analysis of known and novel non-coding RNAs, target prediction, etc., requires implementation of multiple statistical and bioinformatics tools from different sources, each focusing on a specific step of the analysis pipeline. As a consequence, the analytical workflow is slowed down by the need for continuous interventions by the operator, a critical factor when large numbers of datasets need to be analyzed at once.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We designed a novel modular pipeline (iMir) for comprehensive analysis of smallRNA-Seq data, comprising specific tools for adapter trimming, quality filtering, differential expression analysis, biological target prediction and other useful options by integrating multiple open source modules and resources in an automated workflow. As statistics is crucial in deep-sequencing data analysis, we devised and integrated in iMir tools based on different statistical approaches to allow the operator to analyze data rigorously. The pipeline created here proved to be efficient and time-saving than currently available methods and, in addition, flexible enough to allow the user to select the preferred combination of analytical steps. We present here the results obtained by applying this pipeline to analyze simultaneously 6 smallRNA-Seq datasets from either exponentially growing or growth-arrested human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, that led to the rapid and accurate identification, quantitation and differential expression analysis of {\~{}}450 miRNAs, including several novel miRNAs and isomiRs, as well as identification of the putative mRNA targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. In addition, iMir allowed also the identification of {\~{}}70 piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs), some of which differentially expressed in proliferating vs growth arrested cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The integrated data analysis pipeline described here is based on a reliable, flexible and fully automated workflow, useful to rapidly and efficiently analyze high-throughput smallRNA-Seq data, such as those produced by the most recent high-performance next generation sequencers. iMir is available at http://www.labmedmolge.unisa.it/inglese/research/imir.},

abstract = {Galanin is a stress-inducible neuropeptide and cotransmitter in serotonin and norepinephrine neurons with a possible role in stress-related disorders. Here we report that variants in genes for galanin (GAL) and its receptors (GALR1, GALR2, GALR3), despite their disparate genomic loci, conferred increased risk of depression and anxiety in people who experienced childhood adversity or recent negative life events in a European white population cohort totaling 2,361 from Manchester, United Kingdom and Budapest, Hungary. Bayesian multivariate analysis revealed a greater relevance of galanin system genes in highly stressed subjects compared with subjects with moderate or low life stress. Using the same method, the effect of the galanin system genes was stronger than the effect of the well-studied 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). Conventional multivariate analysis using general linear models demonstrated that interaction of galanin system genes with life stressors explained more variance (1.7{\%}, P = 0.005) than the life stress-only model. This effect replicated in independent analysis of the Manchester and Budapest subpopulations, and in males and females. The results suggest that the galanin pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression in humans by increasing the vulnerability to early and recent psychosocial stress. Correcting abnormal galanin function in depression could prove to be a novel target for drug development. The findings further emphasize the importance of modeling environmental interaction in finding new genes for depression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The nature of the protein molecular clock, the protein-specific rate of amino acid substitutions, is among the central questions of molecular evolution. Protein expression level is the dominant determinant of the clock rate in a number of organisms. It has been suggested that highly expressed proteins evolve slowly in all species mainly to maintain robustness to translation errors that generate toxic misfolded proteins. Here we investigate this hypothesis experimentally by comparing the growth rate of Escherichia coli expressing wild type and misfolding-prone variants of the LacZ protein.
RESULTS: We show that the cost of toxic protein misfolding is small compared to other costs associated with protein synthesis. Complementary computational analyses demonstrate that there is also a relatively weaker, but statistically significant, selection for increasing solubility and polarity in highly expressed E. coli proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we cannot rule out the possibility that selection against misfolding toxicity significantly affects the protein clock in species other than E. coli, our results suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant and universal factor determining the clock rate in all organisms. We find that in this bacterium other costs associated with protein synthesis are likely to play an important role. Interestingly, our experiments also suggest significant costs associated with volume effects, such as jamming of the cellular environment with unnecessary proteins.},

abstract = {We introduce a new approach to learning statistical models from multiple sequence alignments (MSA) of proteins. Our method, called GREMLIN (Generative REgularized ModeLs of proteINs), learns an undirected probabilistic graphical model of the amino acid composition within the MSA. The resulting model encodes both the position-specific conservation statistics and the correlated mutation statistics between sequential and long-range pairs of residues. Existing techniques for learning graphical models from MSA either make strong, and often inappropriate assumptions about the conditional independencies within the MSA (e.g., Hidden Markov Models), or else use suboptimal algorithms to learn the parameters of the model. In contrast, GREMLIN makes no a priori assumptions about the conditional independencies within the MSA. We formulate and solve a convex optimization problem, thus guaranteeing that we find a globally optimal model at convergence. The resulting model is also generative, allowing for the design of new protein sequences that have the same statistical properties as those in the MSA. We perform a detailed analysis of covariation statistics on the extensively studied WW and PDZ domains and show that our method out-performs an existing algorithm for learning undirected probabilistic graphical models from MSA. We then apply our approach to 71 additional families from the PFAM database and demonstrate that the resulting models significantly out-perform Hidden Markov Models in terms of predictive accuracy.},

Here we conduct a study of genome-wide mutation rates by sequencing the entire genomes of 78 Icelandic parent-offspring trios at high coverage. We show that in our samples, with an average father's age of 29.7, the average de novo mutation rate is 1.20 × 10(-8) per nucleotide per generation. Most notably, the diversity in mutation rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the father at conception of the child. The effect is an increase of about two mutations per year. An exponential model estimates paternal mutations doubling every 16.5 years. After accounting for random Poisson variation, father's age is estimated to explain nearly all of the remaining variation in the de novo mutation counts. These observations shed light on the importance of the father's age on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia and autism.},

Little is known, however, about how developmentally regulated isoforms and other cognate SNARE components regulate vesicular fusion. To address this question, we examined neuroexocytosis from chromaffin cells of Snap25 null mice rescued by the two splice variants SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b and the ubiquitously expressed homolog SNAP-23. In the absence of SNAP-25, vesicle docking persisted, but primed vesicle pools were empty and fast calcium-triggered release abolished. Single vesicular fusion events showed normal characteristics, except for a shorter duration of the fusion pore. Overexpression of SNAP-25a, SNAP-25b, and SNAP-23 resulted in three distinct phenotypes; SNAP-25b induced larger primed vesicle pools than SNAP-25a, whereas SNAP-23 did not support a standing pool of primed vesicles. We conclude that three alternative SNARE components support exocytosis, but they differ in their ability to stabilize vesicles in the primed state.},

In parallel, we quantified mRNA levels using microarrays. Here we show that a single miRNA can repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression is typically relatively mild. A number of known features of the miRNA-binding site such as the seed sequence also govern repression of human protein synthesis, and we report additional target sequence characteristics. We demonstrate that, in addition to downregulating mRNA levels, miRNAs also directly repress translation of hundreds of genes. Finally, our data suggest that a miRNA can, by direct or indirect effects, tune protein synthesis from thousands of genes.},

abstract = {Assessing the influence of three-dimensional protein structure on sequence evolution is a difficult task, mainly because of the assumption of independence between sites required by probabilistic phylogenetic methods. Recently, models that include an explicit treatment of protein structure and site interdependencies have been developed: a statistical potential (an energy-like scoring system for sequence-structure compatibility) is used to evaluate the probability of fixation of a given mutation, assuming a coarse-grained protein structure that is constant through evolution. Yet, due to the novelty of these models and the small degree of overlap between the fields of structural and evolutionary biology, only simple representations of protein structure have been used so far. In this work, we present new forms of statistical potentials using a probabilistic framework recently developed for evolutionary studies. Terms related to pairwise distance interactions, torsion angles, solvent accessibility, and flexibility of the residues are included in the potentials, so as to study the effects of the main factors known to influence protein structure. The new potentials, with a more detailed representation of the protein structure, yield a better fit than the previously used scoring functions, with pairwise interactions contributing to more than half of this improvement. In a phylogenetic context, however, the structurally constrained models are still outperformed by some of the available site-independent models in terms of fit, possibly indicating that alternatives to coarse-grained statistical potentials should be explored in order to better model structural constraints.},

abstract = {The Na/K pump establishes essential ion concentration gradients across animal cell membranes. Cardiotonic steroids, such as ouabain, are specific inhibitors of the Na/K pump. We exploited the marine toxin, palytoxin, to probe both the ion translocation pathway through the Na/K pump and the site of its interaction with ouabain. Palytoxin uncouples the pump's gates, which normally open strictly alternately, thus allowing both gates to sometimes be open, so transforming the pump into an ion channel. Palytoxin therefore permits electrophysiological analysis of even a single Na/K pump. We used outside-out patch recording of Xenopus alpha1beta3 Na/K pumps, which were made ouabain-resistant by point mutation, after expressing them in Xenopus oocytes. Endogenous, ouabain-sensitive, Xenopus alpha1beta3 Na/K pumps were silenced by continuous exposure to ouabain. We found that side-chain charge of two residues at either end of the alpha subunit's first extracellular loop, known to make a major contribution to ouabain affinity, strongly influenced conductance of single palytoxin-bound pump-channels by an electrostatic mechanism. The effects were mimicked by modification of cysteines introduced at those two positions with variously charged methanethiosulfonate reagents. The consequences of these modifications demonstrate that both residues lie in a wide vestibule near the mouth of the pump's ion pathway. Bound ouabain protects the site with the strongest influence on conductance from methanethiosulfonate modification, while leaving the site with the weaker influence unprotected. The results suggest a method for mapping the footprint of bound cardiotonic steroid on the extracellular surface of the Na/K pump.},

  abstract      = {In proteins, amino acid positions under mutual structural or functional constraints are expected to co-evolve. Identifying co-evolving positions might thus reveal structural and mechanistic information. Correlated patterns between columns in multiple sequence alignments afford a co-evolutionary signal, which however is both obscured by spurious phylogenetic correlations since sequences share evolutionary history, and distorted by incorrect assumptions about molecular evolution. In benchmark studies here we use two contemporary methods that show improved detection of co-evolutionary signals. One, MIp (Bioinformatics 24(3): 333-40), calculates a statistic based on mutual information between position pairs. The other, CAPS (Genetics 173(1): 9-23), unlike MIp, considers physicochemical information using substitution matrices and computes, for each position pair, Pearson's correlation coefficient after pairwise sequence-sequence comparisons. Both methods tend to minimize phylogenetic and entropic (amino acid variability at a position) signals and to identify spatially proximal pairs in 3D structures of proteins suggesting that co-evolving positions are often in physical contact.

We used these two methods to detect co-evolving positions in the Organic Anion and Drug Transporter subfamily of the ATP-binding cassette transporter protein superfamily, exemplified by CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) and MRP1 (Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 1). Inclusion of very similar sequences in the multiple sequence alignment had little effect on MIp's performance whereas it introduced large number of non-significant correlations for CAPS diminishing its power to predict contacting pairs. Considering all position pairs, results by MIp show a small but significant correlation with those by CAPS, suggesting some consistency between these techniques. We identified some pairs in spatial proximity in which two amino acids of distinct physicochemical character swapped positions several times during evolution. Some identified pairs lie on separate domains or separate transmembrane helices and thus possibly stabilize specific conformations during the catalytic cycle.

abstract = {We have determined the variations in volume that occur during evolution in the buried core of three different families of proteins. The variation of the whole core is very small (approximately 2.5{\%}) compared to the variation at individual sites (approximately 13{\%}). However, by comparing our results to those expected from random sequences with no correlations between sites, we show that the small variation observed may simply be a manifestation of the statistical "law of large numbers" and not reflect any compensating changes in, or global constraints upon, protein sequences. We have also analysed in detail the volume variations at individual sites, both in the core and on the surface, and compared these variations with those expected from random sequences. Individual sites on the surface have nearly the same variation as random sequences (24{\%} versus 28{\%} variation). However, individual sites in the core have about half the variation of random sequences (13{\%} versus 30{\%}). Roughly, half of these core sites strongly conserve their volume (0 to 10{\%} variation); one quarter have moderate variation (10 to 20{\%}); and the remaining quarter vary randomly (20 to 40{\%}). Our results have clear implications for the relationship between protein sequence and structure. For our analysis, we have developed a new and simple method for weighting protein sequences to correct for unequal representation, which we describe in an Appendix.},

Although the power to detect association with an individual rare variant is limited, pooling variants by gene or pathway into a composite test provides an alternative strategy for identifying susceptibility genes. We describe a statistical method for detecting association of multiple rare variants in protein-coding genes with a quantitative or dichotomous trait. The approach is based on the regression of phenotypic values on individuals' genotype scores subject to a variable allele-frequency threshold, incorporating computational predictions of the functional effects of missense variants. Statistical significance is assessed by permutation testing with variable thresholds. We used a rigorous population-genetics simulation framework to evaluate the power of the method, and we applied the method to empirical sequencing data from three disease studies.},

abstract = {Probabilistic models of sequence evolution are in widespread use in phylogenetics and molecular sequence evolution. These models have become increasingly sophisticated and combined with statistical model comparison techniques have helped to shed light on how genes and proteins evolve. Models of codon evolution have been particularly useful, because, in addition to providing a significant improvement in model realism for protein-coding sequences, codon models can also be designed to test hypotheses about the selective pressures that shape the evolution of the sequences. Such models typically assume a phylogeny and can be used to identify sites or lineages that have evolved adaptively. Recently some of the key assumptions that underlie phylogenetic tests of selection have been questioned, such as the assumption that the rate of synonymous changes is constant across sites or that a single phylogenetic tree can be assumed at all sites for recombining sequences. While some of these issues have been addressed through the development of novel methods, others remain as caveats that need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Here, we outline the theory of codon models and their application to the detection of positive selection. We review some of the more recent developments that have improved their power and utility, laying a foundation for further advances in the modeling of coding sequence evolution.},

abstract = {The initial synapses of the auditory system, which connect hair cells to afferent nerve fibers, display two unusual features. First, synaptic transmission occurs in a multiquantal fashion: the contents of multiple synaptic vesicles are discharged simultaneously. Second, synaptic transmission may be tuned to specific frequencies of stimulation. We developed a minimal theoretical model to explore the possibility that hair-cell synapses achieve both multiquantal release and frequency selectivity through a cooperative mechanism for the exocytotic release of neurotransmitter. We first characterized vesicle release as a four-step cycle at each release site, then generalized the result to an arbitrary number of steps. The cyclic process itself induces some degree of resonance, and may display a stable, underdamped fixed point of the release dynamics associated with a pair of complex eigenvalues. Cooperativity greatly enhances the frequency selectivity by moving the eigenvalues toward the imaginary axis; spontaneously oscillatory release can arise beyond a Hopf bifurcation. These phenomena occur both in the macroscopic limit, when the number of release sites involved is very large, and in the more realistic stochastic regime, when only a limited number of release sites participate at each synapse. It is thus possible to connect multiquantal release with frequency selectivity through the mechanism of cooperativity.},

abstract = {The cytosolic nucleotide binding domains of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (NBD1 and NBD2) mediate ATP-dependent opening and closing of the Cl- channel pore. To learn more about NBD structure and function, we introduced a cysteine residue into the Walker A motif or the LSGGQ motif of each NBD and examined modification by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Covalent modification of either Walker A motif partially inhibited cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel activity, decreasing the open state probability by prolonging the long closed duration. An increase in cytosolic ATP concentration slowed the rate of modification. The data suggest that both NBDs interact with ATP to influence channel opening and that inhibition by NEM modification was in part due to decreased ATP binding. When cysteine was placed in the NBD2 Walker A motif, it was modified more rapidly than when it was placed in NBD1, suggesting that the NBDs are not structurally or functionally identical. Modification of a cysteine inserted in the LSGGQ motif of either NBD1 or NBD2 also inhibited channel activity. The rate of modification was comparable with that of a thiol in free solution, suggesting that the LSGGQ motif resides in a surface-exposed position in both NBDs.},

The gene duplication and loss process is a major cause for incongruence between gene and species tree, and deterministic methods have been developed to explain such differences through tree reconciliations. Although probabilistic methods for phylogenetic inference have been around for decades, probabilistic reconciliation methods are far less established. Based on our model, we have implemented a Bayesian analysis tool, PrIME-GSR, for gene tree inference that takes a known species tree into account. Our implementation is sound and we demonstrate its utility for genomewide gene-family analysis by applying it to recently presented yeast data. We validate PrIME-GSR by comparing with previous analyses of these data that take advantage of gene order information. In a case study we apply our method to the ADH gene family and are able to draw biologically relevant conclusions concerning gene duplications creating key yeast phenotypes. On a higher level this shows the biological relevance of our method. The obtained results demonstrate the value of a relaxed molecular clock. Our good performance will extend to species where gene order conservation is insufficient.},

Although tools exist for SNV discovery from NGS data, none are specifically suited to work with data from tumors, where altered ploidy and tumor cellularity impact the statistical expectations of SNV discovery.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We developed three implementations of a probabilistic Binomial mixture model, called SNVMix, designed to infer SNVs from NGS data from tumors to address this problem. The first models allelic counts as observations and infers SNVs and model parameters using an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and is therefore capable of adjusting to deviation of allelic frequencies inherent in genomically unstable tumor genomes. The second models nucleotide and mapping qualities of the reads by probabilistically weighting the contribution of a read/nucleotide to the inference of a SNV based on the confidence we have in the base call and the read alignment. The third combines filtering out low-quality data in addition to probabilistic weighting of the qualities. We quantitatively evaluated these approaches on 16 ovarian cancer RNASeq datasets with matched genotyping arrays and a human breast cancer genome sequenced to {\textgreater}40x (haploid) coverage with ground truth data and show systematically that the SNVMix models outperform competing approaches.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: Software and data are available at http://compbio.bccrc.ca$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: sshah@bccrc.ca SUPPLEMANTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Because different types of biological data usually provide complementary information regarding the underlying GRN, a model that integrates big data of diverse types is expected to increase both the power and accuracy of GRN inference. Towards this goal, we propose a novel algorithm named iRafNet: integrative random forest for gene regulatory network inference. RESULTS: iRafNet is a flexible, unified integrative framework that allows information from heterogeneous data, such as protein-protein interactions, transcription factor (TF)-DNA-binding, gene knock-down, to be jointly considered for GRN inference. Using test data from the DREAM4 and DREAM5 challenges, we demonstrate that iRafNet outperforms the original random forest based network inference algorithm (GENIE3), and is highly comparable to the community learning approach. We apply iRafNet to construct GRN in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that it improves the performance in predicting TF-target gene regulations and provides additional functional insights to the predicted gene regulations.

abstract = {A method was developed to identify compensating changes between residues at positions in a multiple sequence alignment. (For example, one position might always contain a positively charged residue when the other is negatively charged and vice versa.) A correlation-based method was used to measure the compensation found in the four residues at a pair of positions in any two sequences in a multiple alignment. All possible sequence pairings were measured at the pair of positions and the resulting matrix analysed to give a measure of cooperativity among the pairs. The basic method was sufficiently flexible to consider a number of amino acid relatedness models based both on scalar and vectorial properties. Pairs of compensating positions were selected by the method and their mean separation (in a protein of known structure) was compared to both the mean pairwise separation over all residues and the pairwise separation over an equivalent sample of pairs of residues selected on the basis of their conservation alone. The latter is an important control that has been omitted from previous studies. The results indicated that, at best, there was a slight effect (of marginal significance) leading to the selection of closer pairs by the compensation measure when compared to the mean of all pairs. However, this was never as good as the simpler measure based on conservation alone, which always found a significant majority of proteins with a sample mean less than the overall mean.},

abstract = {A novel sequence-analysis technique for detecting correlated amino acid positions in intermediate-size protein families (50-100 sequences) was developed, and applied to study voltage-dependent gating of potassium channels. Most contemporary methods for detecting amino acid correlations within proteins use very large sets of data, typically comprising hundreds or thousands of evolutionarily related sequences, to overcome the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio in the analysis of co-variations between pairs of amino acid positions. Such methods are impractical for voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels and for many other protein families that have not yet been sequenced to that extent. Here, we used a phylogenetic reconstruction of paralogous Kv channels to follow the evolutionary history of every pair of amino acid positions within this family, thus increasing detection accuracy of correlated amino acids relative to contemporary methods. In addition, we used a bootstrapping procedure to eliminate correlations that were statistically insignificant. These and other measures allowed us to increase the method's sensitivity, and opened the way to reliable identification of correlated positions even in intermediate-size protein families. Principal-component analysis applied to the set of correlated amino acid positions in Kv channels detected a network of inter-correlated residues, a large fraction of which were identified as gating-sensitive upon mutation. Mapping the network of correlated residues onto the 3D structure of the Kv channel from Aeropyrum pernix disclosed correlations between residues in the voltage-sensor paddle and the pore region, including regions that are involved in the gating transition. We discuss these findings with respect to the evolutionary constraints acting on the channel's various domains. The software is available on our website},

Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

abstract = {Traditional biology was forced to restate some of its principles when the microRNA (miRNA) genes and their regulatory role were firstly discovered. Typically, miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules which have the ability to bind to the 3'untraslated region (UTR) of their mRNA target genes for cleavage or translational repression. Existing experimental techniques for their identification and the prediction of the target genes share some important limitations such as low coverage, time consuming experiments and high cost reagents. Hence, many computational methods have been proposed for these tasks to overcome these limitations. Recently, many researchers emphasized on the development of computational approaches to predict the participation of miRNA genes in regulatory networks and to analyze their transcription mechanisms. All these approaches have certain advantages and disadvantages which are going to be described in the present survey. Our work is differentiated from existing review papers by updating the methodologies list and emphasizing on the computational issues that arise from the miRNA data analysis. Furthermore, in the present survey, the various miRNA data analysis steps are treated as an integrated procedure whose aims and scope is to uncover the regulatory role and mechanisms of the miRNA genes. This integrated view of the miRNA data analysis steps may be extremely useful for all researchers even if they work on just a single step. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The ABC superfamily is a diverse group of integral membrane proteins involved in the ATP-dependent transport of solutes across biological membranes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Although ABC transporters have been studied for over 30 years, very little is known about the mechanism by which the energy of ATP hydrolysis is used to transport substrate across the membrane. The recent report of the high resolution crystal structure of HisP, the nucleotide-binding subunit of the histidine permease complex of Salmonella typhimurium, represents a significant breakthrough toward the elucidation of the mechanism of solute translocation by ABC transporters. In this review, we use data from the crystallographic structures of HisP and other nucleotide-binding proteins, combined with sequence analysis of a subset of atypical ABC transporters, to argue a new model for the dimerisation of the nucleotide-binding domains that embraces the notion that the C motif from one subunit forms part of the ATP-binding site in the opposite subunit. We incorporate this dimerisation of the ATP-binding domains into our recently reported beta-barrel model for P-glycoprotein and present a general model for the cooperative interaction of the two nucleotide-binding domains and the translocation of mechanical energy to the transmembrane domains in ABC transporters.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Whole genome and exome sequencing of matched tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research. The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples. The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal. This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation. A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates. We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.

Although these models give meaningful results when applied to biological data, it is not clear if the 2 assumptions mentioned above hold and, if not, how much sequence evolution processes deviate from them. To this aim, we introduce 2 sets of indices that can be calculated from the nucleotide distribution and the substitution rates. The stationarity indices (STIs) can be used to test the validity of the equilibrium assumption. The irreversibility indices (IRIs) are derived from the Kolmogorov cycle conditions for time reversibility and quantify the degree of nontime reversibility of a process. We have computed STIs and IRIs for the evolutionary process of 2 lineages, Drosophila simulans and Homo sapiens. In the latter case, we use a modified form of the indices that takes into account the CpG decay process. In both cases, we find statistically significant deviations from the ideal case of a process that has reached stationarity and is time reversible.},

Although several algorithms have been developed to detect SCNAs from whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data, their relative performance has not been studied. Here, we have compared ten SCNA detection algorithms in both simulated and primary tumor deep sequencing data. In addition, we have evaluated the applicability of exome sequencing data for SCNA detection.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Polymorphisms in human genes are being described in remarkable numbers. Determining which polymorphisms and which environmental factors are associated with common, complex diseases has become a daunting task. This is partly because the effect of any single genetic variation will likely be dependent on other genetic variations (gene-gene interaction or epistasis) and environmental factors (gene-environment interaction). Detecting and characterizing interactions among multiple factors is both a statistical and a computational challenge. To address this problem, we have developed a multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method for collapsing high-dimensional genetic data into a single dimension thus permitting interactions to be detected in relatively small sample sizes. In this paper, we describe the MDR approach and an MDR software package. RESULTS: We developed a program that integrates MDR with a cross-validation strategy for estimating the classification and prediction error of multifactor models. The software can be used to analyze interactions among 2-15 genetic and/or environmental factors. The dataset may contain up to 500 total variables and a maximum of 4000 study subjects. AVAILABILITY: Information on obtaining the executable code, example data, example analysis, and documentation is available upon request.

abstract = {The isolated epithelium of toad skin was disintegrated into single cells by treatment with collagenase and trypsine. Chloride channels of cell-attached and excised inside-out apical membrane-patches of mitochondria-rich cells were studied by the patch-clamp technique. The major population of Cl- channels constituted small 7-pS linear channels in symmetrical solutions (125 mM Cl-). In cell-attached and inside-out patches the single channel i/V-relationship could be described by electrodiffusion of Cl- with a Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz permeability of, PCl = 1.2 x 10(-14) - 2.6 x 10(-14) cm3. s-1. The channel exhibited voltage-independent activity and could be activated by cAMP. This channel is a likely candidate for mediating the well known cAMP-induced transepithelial Cl- conductance of the amphibian skin epithelium. Another population of Cl- channels exhibited large, highly variable conductances (upper limit conductances, 150-550 pS) and could be activated by membrane depolarization. A group of intermediate-sized Cl(-)-channels included: (a) channels (mean conductance, 30 pS) with linear or slightly outwardly rectifying i/V-relationships and activity occurring in distinct "bursts," (b) channels (conductance-range, 10-27 pS) with marked depolarization-induced activity, and (c) channels with unresolvable kinetics. The variance of current fluctuations of such "noisy" patches exhibited a minimum close to the equilibrium-potential for Cl-. With channels occurring in only 38{\%} of sealed patches and an even lower frequency of voltage-activated channels, the chloride conductance of the apical membrane of mitochondria-rich cells did not match quantitatively that previously estimated from macroscopic Ussing-chamber experiments. From a qualitative point of view, however, we have succeeded in demonstrating the existence of Cl-channels in the apical membrane with features comparable to macroscopic predictions, i.e., activation of channel gating by cAMP and, in a few patches, also by membrane depolarization.},

In humans, clinical studies have implicated mutations in 19 of the 48 known ABC transporters in diseases such as cystic fibrosis and adrenoleukodystrophy. Although divergent in sequence space, the overall topology of these proteins, consisting of two transmembrane domains and two ATP-binding cassettes, is likely to be conserved across diverse organisms. We examine known intra-transporter domain interfaces using crystallographic structures of isolated and complexed domains in ABC transporter proteins and find that the nucleotide binding domain interfaces are better conserved than interfaces at the transmembrane domains. We then apply this analysis to identify known disease-associated point and deletion mutants for which disruption of domain-domain interfaces might indicate the mechanism of disease. Finally, we suggest a possible interaction site based on conservation of sequence and disease-association of point mutants.},

Such alignments reveal positions that exhibit amino acid conservation--either of specific chemical groups in active and binding sites or of the more chemically inert hydrophobic residues that contribute to the protein core. The latter can provide constraints on the position of the protein chain and any local periodicity can suggest the type of secondary structure. Conservation measures, however, cannot provide specific pairwise packing information (each conserved hydrophobic position might pack against any other). However, if correlated changes between positions were observed then specific pairs of residue could be identified as interacting and therefore probably spatially adjacent. Most 'observations' of correlated changes have been anecdotal and of the few systematic studies that have been made, most have mistakenly incorporated a strong bias towards selecting conserved positions. When the conservation effect is separated (as best as possible) then little correlation signal remains to help identify adjacent positions.},

To help reduce this inflation, we used a more general LMM with two random effects-one based on genomic variants and one based on easily measured spatial location as a proxy for environmental effects. We investigated this approach with simulated data and with data from a Uganda cohort of 4,778 individuals for 34 phenotypes including anthropometric indices, blood factors, glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid tests, and liver function tests. For the genomic random effect, we used identity-by-descent estimates from accurately phased genome-wide data. For the environmental random effect, we constructed a covariance matrix based on a Gaussian radial basis function. Across the simulated and Ugandan data, narrow-sense heritability estimates were lower using the more general model. Thus, our approach addresses, in part, the issue of "missing heritability" in the sense that much of the heritability previously thought to be missing was fictional.

To speed up discovery and limit the number of costly wet lab experiments, biologists must test the candidate genes starting with the most probable candidates. So far, biologists have relied on literature studies, extensive queries to multiple databases and hunches about expected properties of the disease gene to determine such an ordering.

abstract = {Universal common ancestry (UCA) is a central pillar of modern evolutionary theory. As first suggested by Darwin, the theory of UCA posits that all extant terrestrial organisms share a common genetic heritage, each being the genealogical descendant of a single species from the distant past. The classic evidence for UCA, although massive, is largely restricted to 'local' common ancestry-for example, of specific phyla rather than the entirety of life-and has yet to fully integrate the recent advances from modern phylogenetics and probability theory. Although UCA is widely assumed, it has rarely been subjected to formal quantitative testing, and this has led to critical commentary emphasizing the intrinsic technical difficulties in empirically evaluating a theory of such broad scope. Furthermore, several researchers have proposed that early life was characterized by rampant horizontal gene transfer, leading some to question the monophyly of life. Here I provide the first, to my knowledge, formal, fundamental test of UCA, without assuming that sequence similarity implies genetic kinship. I test UCA by applying model selection theory to molecular phylogenies, focusing on a set of ubiquitously conserved proteins that are proposed to be orthologous. Among a wide range of biological models involving the independent ancestry of major taxonomic groups, the model selection tests are found to overwhelmingly support UCA irrespective of the presence of horizontal gene transfer and symbiotic fusion events. These results provide powerful statistical evidence corroborating the monophyly of all known life.},

abstract = {Identification of functional genetic variants and elucidation of their regulatory mechanisms represent significant challenges of the post-genomic era. A poorly understood topic is the involvement of genetic variants in mediating post-transcriptional RNA processing, including alternative splicing. Thus far, little is known about the genomic, evolutionary, and regulatory features of genetically modulated alternative splicing (GMAS). Here, we systematically identified intronic tag variants for genetic modulation of alternative splicing using RNA-seq data specific to cellular compartments. Combined with our previous method that identifies exonic tags for GMAS, this study yielded 622 GMAS exons. We observed that GMAS events are highly cell type independent, indicating that splicing-altering genetic variants could have widespread function across cell types. Interestingly, GMAS genes, exons, and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) all demonstrated positive selection or accelerated evolution in primates. We predicted that GMAS SNVs often alter binding of splicing factors, with SRSF1 affecting the most GMAS events and demonstrating global allelic binding bias. However, in contrast to their GMAS targets, the predicted splicing factors are more conserved than expected, suggesting thatcis-regulatory variation is the major driving force of splicing evolution. Moreover, GMAS-related splicing factors had stronger consensus motifs than expected, consistent with their susceptibility to SNV disruption. Intriguingly, GMAS SNVs in general do not alter the strongest consensus position of the splicing factor motif, except the more than 100 GMAS SNVs in linkage disequilibrium with polymorphisms reported by genome-wide association studies. Our study reports many GMAS events and enables a better understanding of the evolutionary and regulatory features of this phenomenon.},

Although noncoding RNAs have been most often implicated in posttranscriptional gene silencing, these molecules are now emerging as critical regulators of gene expression and genomic stability at the transcriptional level. Here, we review recent efforts to understand the mechanisms by which RNA controls the expression or content of DNA. We discuss the role of both small RNAs and long noncoding RNAs in directing chromatin changes through histone modifications and DNA methylation. Furthermore, we highlight the function of RNA in mediating DNA cleavage during genome rearrangements and pathogen defense.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Some functionally important protein residues are easily detected since they correspond to conserved columns in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). However important residues may also mutate, with compensatory mutations occurring elsewhere in the protein, which serve to preserve or restore functionality. It is difficult to distinguish these co-evolving sites from other non-conserved sites. RESULTS: We used Mutual Information (MI) to identify co-evolving positions. Using in silico evolved MSAs, we examined the effects of the number of sequences, the size of amino acid alphabet and the mutation rate on two sources of background MI: finite sample size effects and phylogenetic influence. We then assessed the performance of various normalizations of MI in enhancing detection of co-evolving positions and found that normalization by the pair entropy was optimal. Real protein alignments were analyzed and co-evolving isolated pairs were often found to be in contact with each other.

abstract = {A loss-of-function point mutation in a protein is often rescued by an additional mutation that compensates for the original physical change. According to one hypothesis, such compensation would be most effective in maintaining a structural motif if the two mutated residues were spatial neighbors. If this hypothesis were correct, one would expect that many such compensatory mutations have occurred during evolution and that present-day protein families show some degree of correlation in the occurrence of amino acid residues at positions whose side chains are in contact. Here, a statistical theory is presented which allows evaluation of correlations in a family of aligned protein sequences by assigning a scalar metric (such as charge or side-chain volume) to each type of amino acid and calculating correlation coefficients of these quantities at different positions. For the family of myoglobins it is found that there is a high correlation between fluctuations in neighboring charges. The correlation is close to what would be expected for total conservation of local charge. For the metric side-chain volume, on the other hand, no correlation could be found.},

abstract = {To date, three molecular markers (ER, PR, and CYP2D6) have been used in clinical setting to predict the benefit of the anti-estrogen tamoxifen therapy. Our aim was to validate new biomarker candidates predicting response to tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer by evaluating these in a meta-analysis of available transcriptomic datasets with known treatment and follow-up. Biomarker candidates were identified in Pubmed and in the 2007-2012 ASCO and 2011-2012 SABCS abstracts. Breast cancer microarray datasets of endocrine therapy-treated patients were downloaded from GEO and EGA and RNAseq datasets from TCGA. Of the biomarker candidates, only those identified or already validated in a clinical cohort were included. Relapse-free survival (RFS) up to 5 years was used as endpoint in a ROC analysis in the GEO and RNAseq datasets. In the EGA dataset, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for overall survival. Statistical significance was set at p {\textless} 0.005. The transcriptomic datasets included 665 GEO-based and 1,208 EGA-based patient samples. All together 68 biomarker candidates were identified. Of these, the best performing genes were PGR (AUC = 0.64, p = 2.3E-07), MAPT (AUC = 0.62, p = 7.8E-05), and SLC7A5 (AUC = 0.62, p = 9.2E-05). Further genes significantly correlated to RFS include FOS, TP53, BTG2, HOXB7, DRG1, CXCL10, and TPM4. In the RNAseq dataset, only ERBB2, EDF1, and MAPK1 reached statistical significance. We evaluated tamoxifen-resistance genes in three independent platforms and identified PGR, MAPT, and SLC7A5 as the most promising prognostic biomarkers in tamoxifen treated patients.},

abstract = {Prediction of protein structures continues to be a difficult problem, particularly when there are no solved structures for homologous proteins to use as templates. Local structure prediction (secondary structure and burial) is fairly reliable, but does not provide enough information to produce complete three-dimensional structures. Residue-residue contact prediction, though still not highly reliable, may provide a useful guide for assembling local structure prediction into full tertiary prediction. We develop a neural network which is applied to pairs of residue positions and outputs a probability of contact between the positions. One of the neural net inputs is a novel statistic for detecting correlated mutations: the statistical significance of the mutual information between the corresponding columns of a multiple sequence alignment. This statistic, combined with a second statistic based on the propensity of two amino acid types being in contact, results in a simple neural network that is a good predictor of contacts. Adding more features from amino-acid distributions and local structure predictions, the final neural network predicts contacts better than other submitted contact predictions at CASP7, including contact predictions derived from fragment-based tertiary models on free-modeling domains. It is still not known if contact predictions can improve tertiary models on free-modeling domains. Available at http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/SAM{\_}T06/T06-query.html.},

However, despite the increasing availability of multiple additional -omics data, this quest has been frustrated by various theoretical and technical hurdles, mostly related to the dramatic heterogeneity and temporality of the disease. In this paper, we build on our recent works on selectivity relation among driver mutations in cancer progression and investigate their applicability to the modeling problem - both at the population and individual levels. On one hand, we devise an optimal, versatile and modular pipeline to extract ensemble-level progression models from cross sectional sequenced cancer genomes. The pipeline combines state-of-the-art techniques for sample stratification, driver selection, identification of fitness-equivalent exclusive alterations and progression model inference. We demonstrate this pipeline's ability to reproduce much of the current knowledge on colorectal cancer progression, as well as to suggest novel experimentally verifiable hypotheses. On the other hand, we prove that our framework can be applied, mutatis mutandis, in reconstructing the evolutionary history of cancer clones in single patients, as illustrated by an example with multiple biopsy data from clear cell renal carcinomas.},

Among other things, we suggest measures that are variants of Mutual Information, and measures that use a multidimensional representation of each residue in order to capture the physico-chemical similarities between amino acids. We created a benchmarking system, in silico, able to evaluate these methods through a wide range of realistic conditions. Finally, we use the combination of different methods as a way of improving performance. CONCLUSION: Our best method (Row and Column Weighed Mutual Information) has an estimated accuracy increase of 63{\%} over Mutual Information. Furthermore, we show that the combination of different methods is efficient, and that the methods are quite sensitive to the different conditions tested.},

We report identification of long regions with haplotypes co-inherited between pairs of individuals and methodology to leverage such shared genetic content for imputation. Our estimates show that sequencing as few as 40 personal genomes allows for inference in up to 60{\%} of the 3000-person cohort at the average locus. We ascertained a pilot data set of whole-genome sequences from seven Kosraean individuals, with average 5× coverage. This assay identified 5,735,306 unique sites of which 1,212,831 were previously unknown. Additionally, these variants are unusually enriched for alleles that are rare in other populations when compared to geographic neighbors (published Korean genome SJK). We used the presence of shared haplotypes between the seven Kosraen individuals to estimate expected imputation accuracy of known and novel homozygous variants at 99.6{\%} and 97.3{\%}, respectively.

An essential activity of the ectodomains of these proteins is the specific recognition of cognate ligands, which are often other members of the IgSF. In this work, we provide functional insight for this important class of proteins through the development of a clustering algorithm that groups together extracellular domains of the IgSF with similar binding preferences. Information from hidden Markov model-based sequence profiles and domain architecture is calibrated against manually curated protein interaction data to define functional families of IgSF proteins. The method is able to assign 82{\%} of the 477 extracellular IgSF protein to a functional family, while the rest are either single proteins with unique function or proteins that could not be assigned with the current technology. The functional clustering of IgSF proteins generates hypotheses regarding the identification of new cognate receptor-ligand pairs and reduces the pool of possible interacting partners to a manageable level for experimental validation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {While conventional approaches to causal inference are mainly based on conditional (in)dependences, recent methods also account for the shape of (conditional) distributions. The idea is that the causal hypothesis "X causes Y" imposes that the marginal distribution PX and the conditional distribution PY| X represent independent mechanisms of nature. Recently it has been postulated that the shortest description of the joint distribution PX, Y should therefore be given by separate descriptions of PX and PY| X. Since description length in the sense of Kolmogorov complexity is uncomputable, practical implementations rely on other notions of independence. Here we define independence via orthogonality in information space. This way, we can explicitly describe the kind of dependence that occurs between PY and PX| Y making the causal hypothesis "Y causes X" implausible. Remarkably, this asymmetry between cause and effect becomes particularly simple if X and Y are deterministically related. We present an inference method that works in this case. We also discuss some theoretical results for the non-deterministic case although it is not clear how to employ them for a more general inference method. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {CFTR, the chloride channel dysfunctional in cystic fibrosis, belongs to the exporter class of ABC transporters. These proteins contain two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and two transmembrane domains (TMDs), and each TMD incorporates two long intracellular loops (ICLs). X-ray structures of Sav1866 and MsbA, bacterial members of this class of ABC proteins, show strong interaction between each NBD and the C-terminal ICL of the `opposite' TMD. Our homology model of CFTR based on Sav1866 reveals a tight hydrophobic interface between NBD1 and ICL4 that includes F508 (NBD1), whose deletion causes misfolding and underlies most cases of cystic fibrosis. Statistical coupling analysis of ABC protein sequences predicts that F508 is part of a conserved network of energetically connected positions. The same network contains ICL4 residue L1065, which is found adjacent to F508 in the structural model, implying that these residues functionally link NBD1 to ICL4. In oocytes, F508D, F508R or L1065D mutations strongly attenuated forskolin-induced membrane conductance, consistent with charge introduction disrupting a hydrophobic interface. In contrast, even partially cysteine-depleted split (after 633) CFTR containing both F508C and L1065C still generated substantial forskolin-induced conductance. However, BMOE, a short cysteine-specific crosslinker reduced that conductance, indicating that crosslinking between F508C and L1065C trapped channels in a closed conformation. Indeed, Western blots of oocyte membranes containing split CFTR that included both F508C and L1065C mutations revealed a BMOE-induced crosslinked product with reduced mobility. These results suggest that CFTR's F508 and L1065 represent an evolutionarily conserved interaction pair at the NBD1-ICL4 interface in the exporter class of ABC transporters, and that this interaction is required for maturation and ion channel function of CFTR.

abstract = {Ion binding to secondary active transporters triggers a cascade of conformational rearrangements resulting in substrate translocation across cellular membranes. Despite the fundamental role of this step, direct measurements of binding to transporters are rare. We investigated ion binding and selectivity in CLC-ec1, a H(+)-Cl(-) exchanger of the CLC family of channels and transporters. Cl(-) affinity depends on the conformation of the protein: it is highest with the extracellular gate removed and weakens as the transporter adopts the occluded configuration and with the intracellular gate removed. The central ion-binding site determines selectivity in CLC transporters and channels. A serine-to-proline substitution at this site confers NO(3)(-) selectivity upon the Cl(-)-specific CLC-ec1 transporter and CLC-0 channel. We propose that CLC-ec1 operates through an affinity-switch mechanism and that the bases of substrate specificity are conserved in the CLC channels and transporters.},

abstract = {Knowledge-based approaches frequently employ empirical relations to determine effective potentials for coarse-grained protein models directly from protein databank structures. Although these approaches have enjoyed considerable success and widespread popularity in computational protein science, their fundamental basis has been widely questioned. It is well established that conventional knowledge-based approaches do not correctly treat many-body correlations between amino acids. Moreover, the physical significance of potentials determined by using structural statistics from different proteins has remained obscure. In the present work, we address both of these concerns by introducing and demonstrating a theory for calculating transferable potentials directly from a databank of protein structures. This approach assumes that the databank structures correspond to representative configurations sampled from equilibrium solution ensembles for different proteins. Given this assumption, this physics-based theory exactly treats many-body structural correlations and directly determines the transferable potentials that provide a variationally optimized approximation to the free energy landscape for each protein. We illustrate this approach by first constructing a databank of protein structures using a model potential and then quantitatively recovering this potential from the structure databank. The proposed framework will clarify the assumptions and physical significance of knowledge-based potentials, allow for their systematic improvement, and provide new insight into many-body correlations and cooperativity in folded proteins.},

abstract = {Identification of driver mutations in human diseases is often limited by cohort size and availability of appropriate statistical models. We propose a framework for the systematic discovery of genetic alterations that are causal determinants of disease, by prioritizing genes upstream of functional disease drivers, within regulatory networks inferred de novo from experimental data. We tested this framework by identifying the genetic determinants of the mesenchymal subtype of glioblastoma. Our analysis uncovered KLHL9 deletions as upstream activators of two previously established master regulators of the subtype, C/EBP$\beta$ and C/EBP$\delta$. Rescue of KLHL9 expression induced proteasomal degradation of C/EBP proteins, abrogated the mesenchymal signature, and reduced tumor viability in vitro and in vivo. Deletions of KLHL9 were confirmed in {\textgreater} 50{\%} of mesenchymal cases in an independent cohort, thus representing the most frequent genetic determinant of the subtype. The method generalized to study other human diseases, including breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Evolvability - the capacity to generate beneficial heritable variation - is a central property of biological systems. However, its origins and modulation by environmental factors have not been examined systematically. Here, we analyze the fitness effects of all single mutations in TEM-1 ??-lactamase (4,997 variants) under selection for the wild-type function (ampicillin resistance) and for a new function (cefotaxime resistance). Tolerance to mutation in this enzyme is bimodal and dependent on the strength of purifying selection in vivo, a result that derives from a steep non-linear ampicillin-dependent relationship between biochemical activity and fitness. Interestingly, cefotaxime resistance emerges from mutations that are neutral at low levels of ampicillin but deleterious at high levels; thus the capacity to evolve new function also depends on the strength of selection. The key property controlling evolvability is an excess of enzymatic activity relative to the strength of selection, suggesting that fluctuating environments might select for high-activity enzymes.

abstract = {MOTIVATION Advances in sequencing technologies have remarkably lowered the detection limit of somatic variants to a low frequency. However, calling mutations at this range is still confounded by many factors including environmental contamination. Vector contamination is a continuously occurring issue and is especially problematic since vector inserts are hardly distinguishable from the sample sequences. Such inserts, which may harbor polymorphisms and engineered functional mutations, can result in calling false variants at corresponding sites. Numerous vector-screening methods have been developed, but none could handle contamination from inserts because they are focusing on vector backbone sequences alone. RESULTS We developed a novel method-Vecuum-that identifies vector-originated reads and resultant false variants. Since vector inserts are generally constructed from intron-less cDNAs, Vecuum identifies vector-originated reads by inspecting the clipping patterns at exon junctions. False variant calls are further detected based on the biased distribution of mutant alleles to vector-originated reads. Tests on simulated and spike-in experimental data validated that Vecuum could detect 93{\%} of vector contaminants and could remove up to 87{\%} of variant-like false calls with 100{\%} precision. Application to public sequence datasets demonstrated the utility of Vecuum in detecting false variants resulting from various types of external contamination.

abstract = {A central goal of computational biology is the prediction of phenotype from DNA and protein sequence data. Recent models of sequence change use in silico prediction systems to incorporate the effects of phenotype on evolutionary rates. These models have been designed for analyzing sequence data from different species and have been accompanied by statistical techniques for estimating model parameters when the incorporation of phenotype induces dependent change among sequence positions. A difficulty with these efforts to link phenotype and interspecific evolution is that evolution occurs within populations, and parameters of interspecific models should have population genetic interpretations. We show, with two examples, how population genetic interpretations can be assigned to evolutionary models. The first example considers the impact of RNA secondary structure on sequence change, and the second reflects the tendency for protein tertiary structure to influence nonsynonymous substitution rates. We argue that statistical fit to data should not be the sole criterion for assessing models of sequence change. A good interspecific model should also yield a clear and biologically plausible population genetic interpretation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND A feature common to all DNA sequencing technologies is the presence of base-call errors in the sequenced reads. The implications of such errors are application specific, ranging from minor informatics nuisances to major problems affecting biological inferences. Recently developed "next-gen" sequencing technologies have greatly reduced the cost of sequencing, but have been shown to be more error prone than previous technologies. Both position specific (depending on the location in the read) and sequence specific (depending on the sequence in the read) errors have been identified in Illumina and Life Technology sequencing platforms. We describe a new type of systematic error that manifests as statistically unlikely accumulations of errors at specific genome (or transcriptome) locations. RESULTS We characterize and describe systematic errors using overlapping paired reads from high-coverage data. We show that such errors occur in approximately 1 in 1000 base pairs, and that they are highly replicable across experiments. We identify motifs that are frequent at systematic error sites, and describe a classifier that distinguishes heterozygous sites from systematic error. Our classifier is designed to accommodate data from experiments in which the allele frequencies at heterozygous sites are not necessarily 0.5 (such as in the case of RNA-Seq), and can be used with single-end datasets. CONCLUSIONS Systematic errors can easily be mistaken for heterozygous sites in individuals, or for SNPs in population analyses. Systematic errors are particularly problematic in low coverage experiments, or in estimates of allele-specific expression from RNA-Seq data. Our characterization of systematic error has allowed us to develop a program, called SysCall, for identifying and correcting such errors. We conclude that correction of systematic errors is important to consider in the design and interpretation of high-throughput sequencing experiments.},

abstract = {Scientific innovation depends on finding, integrating, and re-using the products of previous research. Here we explore how recent developments in Web technology, particularly those related to the publication of data and metadata, might assist that process by providing semantic enhancements to journal articles within the mainstream process of scholarly journal publishing. We exemplify this by describing semantic enhancements we have made to a recent biomedical research article taken from PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, providing enrichment to its content and increased access to datasets within it. These semantic enhancements include provision of live DOIs and hyperlinks; semantic markup of textual terms, with links to relevant third-party information resources; interactive figures; a re-orderable reference list; a document summary containing a study summary, a tag cloud, and a citation analysis; and two novel types of semantic enrichment: the first, a Supporting Claims Tooltip to permit "Citations in Context", and the second, Tag Trees that bring together semantically related terms. In addition, we have published downloadable spreadsheets containing data from within tables and figures, have enriched these with provenance information, and have demonstrated various types of data fusion (mashups) with results from other research articles and with Google Maps. We have also published machine-readable RDF metadata both about the article and about the references it cites, for which we developed a Citation Typing Ontology, CiTO (http://purl.org/net/cito/). The enhanced article, which is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000228.x001, presents a compelling existence proof of the possibilities of semantic publication. We hope the showcase of examples and ideas it contains, described in this paper, will excite the imaginations of researchers and publishers, stimulating them to explore the possibilities of semantic publishing for their own research articles, and thereby break down present barriers to the discovery and re-use of information within traditional modes of scholarly communication.},

abstract = {Protein kinases play a critical role in the integration of signaling networks in eukaryotic cells. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) serves as a prototype for this large and highly diverse enzyme family. The catalytic subunit of PKA provides the best example of how a protein kinase recognizes its substrates, as well as inhibitors, and also show how the enzyme moves through the steps of catalysis. Many of the relevant conformational states associated with the catalytic cycle which have been captured in a crystal lattice are summarized here. From these structures, we can begin to appreciate the molecular events of catalysis as well as the intricate orchestration of critical residues in the catalytic subunit that contribute to catalysis. The entire molecule participates. To fully understand signaling by PKA, however, requires an understanding of a large set of related proteins, not just the catalytic subunit. This includes the regulatory subunits that serve as receptors for cAMP and the A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that serve as scaffolds for PKA. The AKAPs localize PKA to specific sites in the cell by docking to the N-terminus of the regulatory subunits, thus creating microenvironments for PKA signaling. To fully appreciate the diversity and integration of these molecules, one needs not only high-resolution structures but also an appreciation of how these molecules behave in solution. Thus, in addition to obtaining high-resolution structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR, we have used fluorescent tools and also hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry to probe the dynamic properties of these proteins and how they interact with one another. The molecular features of these molecules are described. Finally, we describe a new recombinantly expressed PKA reporter that allows us to monitor PKA activity in living cells.},

abstract = {CFTR is the only ABC (ATP-binding cassette) ATPase known to be an ion channel. Studies of CFTR channel function, feasible with single-molecule resolution, therefore provide a unique glimpse of ABC transporter mechanism. CFTR channel opening and closing (after regulatory-domain phosphorylation) follows an irreversible cycle, driven by ATP binding/hydrolysis at the nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1, NBD2). Recent work suggests that formation of an NBD1/NBD2 dimer drives channel opening, and disruption of the dimer after ATP hydrolysis drives closure, but how NBD events are translated into gate movements is unclear. To elucidate conformational properties of channels on their way to opening or closing, we performed non-equilibrium thermodynamic analysis. Human CFTR channel currents were recorded at temperatures from 15 to 35 degrees C in inside-out patches excised from Xenopus oocytes. Activation enthalpies(DeltaH(double dagger)) were determined from Eyring plots. DeltaH(double dagger) was 117 +/- 6 and 69 +/- 4 kJ/mol, respectively, for opening and closure of partially phosphorylated, and 96 +/- 6 and 73 +/- 5 kJ/mol for opening and closure of highly phosphorylated wild-type (WT) channels. DeltaH(double dagger) for reversal of the channel opening step, estimated from closure of ATP hydrolysis-deficient NBD2 mutant K1250R and K1250A channels, and from unlocking of WT channels locked open with ATP+AMPPNP, was 43 +/- 2, 39 +/- 4, and 37 +/- 6 kJ/mol, respectively. Calculated upper estimates of activation free energies yielded minimum estimates of activation entropies (DeltaS(double dagger)), allowing reconstruction of the thermodynamic profile of gating, which was qualitatively similar for partially and highly phosphorylated CFTR. DeltaS(double dagger) appears large for opening but small for normal closure. The large DeltaH(double dagger) and DeltaS(double dagger) (TDeltaS(double dagger) {\textgreater}/= 41 kJ/mol) for opening suggest that the transition state is a strained channel molecule in which the NBDs have already dimerized, while the pore is still closed. The small DeltaS(double dagger) for normal closure is appropriate for cleavage of a single bond (ATP's beta-gamma phosphate bond), and suggests that this transition state does not require large-scale protein motion and hence precedes rehydration (disruption) of the dimer interface.},

abstract = {Aging is one of the most important biological processes and is a known risk factor for many age-related diseases in human. Studying age-related transcriptomic changes in tissues across the whole body can provide valuable information for a holistic understanding of this fundamental process. In this work, we catalogue age-related gene expression changes in nine tissues from nearly two hundred individuals collected by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. In general, we find the aging gene expression signatures are very tissue specific. However, enrichment for some well-known aging components such as mitochondria biology is observed in many tissues. Different levels of cross-tissue synchronization of age-related gene expression changes are observed, and some essential tissues (e.g., heart and lung) show much stronger "co-aging" than other tissues based on a principal component analysis. The aging gene signatures and complex disease genes show a complex overlapping pattern and only in some cases, we see that they are significantly overlapped in the tissues affected by the corresponding diseases. In summary, our analyses provide novel insights to the co-regulation of age-related gene expression in multiple tissues; it also presents a tissue-specific view of the link between aging and age-related diseases.},

abstract = {Unraveling the evolutionary forces responsible for variations of neutral substitution patterns among taxa or along genomes is a major issue for detecting selection within sequences. Mammalian genomes show large-scale regional variations of GC-content (the isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this structure are poorly understood. We analyzed the pattern of neutral substitutions in 1 Gb of primate non-coding regions. We show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is strongly negatively correlated to the distance to telomeres and positively correlated to the rate of crossovers (R2 = 47{\%}). This demonstrates that recombination has a major impact on substitution patterns in human, driving the evolution of GC-content. The evolution of GC-content correlates much more strongly with male than with female crossover rate, which rules out selectionist models for the evolution of isochores. This effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the neutral process of biased gene conversion (BGC) occurring within recombination hotspots. We show that the predictions of this model fit very well with the observed substitution patterns in the human genome. This model notably explains the positive correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate. Theoretical calculations indicate that variations in population size or density in recombination hotspots can have a very strong impact on the evolution of base composition. Furthermore, recombination hotspots can create strong substitution hotspots. This molecular drive affects both coding and non-coding regions. We therefore conclude that along with mutation, selection and drift, BGC is one of the major factors driving genome evolution. Our results also shed light on variations in the rate of crossover relative to non-crossover events, along chromosomes and according to sex, and also on the conservation of hotspot density between human and chimp.},

abstract = {Reversible phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine is the most widely studied posttranslational modification of proteins. The number of phosphorylated sites on a protein (n) shows a significant increase from prokaryotes, with n {\textless}/= 7 sites, to eukaryotes, with examples having n {\textgreater}/= 150 sites. Multisite phosphorylation has many roles and site conservation indicates that increasing numbers of sites cannot be due merely to promiscuous phosphorylation. A substrate with n sites has an exponential number (2(n)) of phospho-forms and individual phospho-forms may have distinct biological effects. The distribution of these phospho-forms and how this distribution is regulated have remained unknown. Here we show that, when kinase and phosphatase act in opposition on a multisite substrate, the system can exhibit distinct stable phospho-form distributions at steady state and that the maximum number of such distributions increases with n. Whereas some stable distributions are focused on a single phospho-form, others are more diffuse, giving the phospho-proteome the potential to behave as a fluid regulatory network able to encode information and flexibly respond to varying demands. Such plasticity may underlie complex information processing in eukaryotic cells and suggests a functional advantage in having many sites. Our results follow from the unusual geometry of the steady-state phospho-form concentrations, which we show to constitute a rational algebraic curve, irrespective of n. We thereby reduce the complexity of calculating steady states from simulating 3 x 2(n) differential equations to solving two algebraic equations, while treating parameters symbolically. We anticipate that these methods can be extended to systems with multiple substrates and multiple enzymes catalysing different modifications, as found in posttranslational modification 'codes' such as the histone code. Whereas simulations struggle with exponentially increasing molecular complexity, mathematical methods of the kind developed here can provide a new language in which to articulate the principles of cellular information processing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measuring similarity between diseases plays an important role in disease-related molecular function research. Functional associations between disease-related genes and semantic associations between diseases are often used to identify pairs of similar diseases from different perspectives. Currently, it is still a challenge to exploit both of them to calculate disease similarity. Therefore, a new method (SemFunSim) that integrates semantic and functional association is proposed to address the issue.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: SemFunSim is designed as follows. First of all, FunSim (Functional similarity) is proposed to calculate disease similarity using disease-related gene sets in a weighted network of human gene function. Next, SemSim (Semantic Similarity) is devised to calculate disease similarity using the relationship between two diseases from Disease Ontology. Finally, FunSim and SemSim are integrated to measure disease similarity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The high average AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) (96.37{\%}) shows that SemFunSim achieves a high true positive rate and a low false positive rate. 79 of the top 100 pairs of similar diseases identified by SemFunSim are annotated in the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) as being targeted by the same therapeutic compounds, while other methods we compared could identify 35 or less such pairs among the top 100. Moreover, when using our method on diseases without annotated compounds in CTD, we could confirm many of our predicted candidate compounds from literature. This indicates that SemFunSim is an effective method for drug repositioning.},

We argue that these differences are caused in part by differing sensitivities to background conservation.

abstract = {CFTR, the protein defective in cystic fibrosis, functions as a Cl- channel regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). CFTR is also an ATPase, comprising two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) thought to bind and hydrolyze ATP. In hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphates, PKA-phosphorylated CFTR channels open into bursts, lasting on the order of a second, from closed (interburst) intervals of a second or more. To investigate nucleotide interactions underlying channel gating, we examined photolabeling by [alpha32P]8-N3ATP or [gamma32P]8-N3ATP of intact CFTR channels expressed in HEK293T cells or Xenopus oocytes. We also exploited split CFTR channels to distinguish photolabeling at NBD1 from that at NBD2. To examine simple binding of nucleotide in the absence of hydrolysis and gating reactions, we photolabeled after incubation at 0 degrees C with no washing. Nucleotide interactions under gating conditions were probed by photolabeling after incubation at 30 degrees C, with extensive washing, also at 30 degrees C. Phosphorylation of CFTR by PKA only slightly influenced photolabeling after either protocol. Strikingly, at 30 degrees C nucleotide remained tightly bound at NBD1 for many minutes, in the form of nonhydrolyzed nucleoside triphosphate. As nucleotide-dependent gating of CFTR channels occurred on the time scale of seconds under comparable conditions, this suggests that the nucleotide interactions, including hydrolysis, that time CFTR channel opening and closing occur predominantly at NBD2. Vanadate also appeared to act at NBD2, presumably interrupting its hydrolytic cycle, and markedly delayed termination of channel open bursts. Vanadate somewhat increased the magnitude, but did not alter the rate, of the slow loss of nucleotide tightly bound at NBD1. Kinetic analysis of channel gating in Mg8-N3ATP or MgATP reveals that the rate-limiting step for CFTR channel opening at saturating [nucleotide] follows nucleotide binding to both NBDs. We propose that ATP remains tightly bound or occluded at CFTR's NBD1 for long periods, that binding of ATP at NBD2 leads to channel opening wherupon its hydrolysis prompts channel closing, and that phosphorylation acts like an automobile clutch that engages the NBD events to drive gating of the transmembrane ion pore.},

The narrow selectivity filter is only 12 angstroms long, whereas the remainder of the pore is wider and lined with hydrophobic amino acids. A large water-filled cavity and helix dipoles are positioned so as to overcome electrostatic destabilization of an ion in the pore at the center of the bilayer. Main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms from the K+ channel signature sequence line the selectivity filter, which is held open by structural constraints to coordinate K+ ions but not smaller Na+ ions. The selectivity filter contains two K+ ions about 7.5 angstroms apart. This configuration promotes ion conduction by exploiting electrostatic repulsive forces to overcome attractive forces between K+ ions and the selectivity filter. The architecture of the pore establishes the physical principles underlying selective K+ conduction.},

The extent to which weak negative and positive darwinian selection have driven the molecular evolution of different species varies greatly, with some species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, showing strong evidence of pervasive positive selection, and others, such as the selfing weed Arabidopsis thaliana, showing an excess of deleterious variation within local populations. Here we contrast patterns of coding sequence polymorphism identified by direct sequencing of 39 humans for over 11,000 genes to divergence between humans and chimpanzees, and find strong evidence that natural selection has shaped the recent molecular evolution of our species. Our analysis discovered 304 (9.0{\%}) out of 3,377 potentially informative loci showing evidence of rapid amino acid evolution. Furthermore, 813 (13.5{\%}) out of 6,033 potentially informative loci show a paucity of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees, indicating weak negative selection and/or balancing selection operating on mutations at these loci. We find that the distribution of negatively and positively selected genes varies greatly among biological processes and molecular functions, and that some classes, such as transcription factors, show an excess of rapidly evolving genes, whereas others, such as cytoskeletal proteins, show an excess of genes with extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans and yet little amino acid divergence between humans and chimpanzees.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mutual Information (MI) is a quantity that measures the dependence between two arbitrary random variables and has been repeatedly used to solve a wide variety of bioinformatic problems. Recently, when attempting to quantify the effects of sampling variance on computed values of MI in proteins, we encountered striking differences among various novel estimates of MI. These differences revealed that estimating the "true" value of MI is not a straightforward procedure, and minor variations of assumptions yielded remarkably different estimates. RESULTS: We describe four formally-equivalent estimates of MI, three of which explicitly account for sampling variance, that yield non-equal values of MI even given exact frequencies. These MI estimates are essentially non-predictive of each other, converging only in the limit of implausibly large data sets. Lastly, we show that all four estimates are biologically-reasonable estimates of MI, despite their disparity, since each is actually the Kullback-Leibler divergence between random variables conditioned on equally-plausible hypotheses. Conclusions: For sparse contingency tables of the type universally observed in protein coevolution studies, our results show that estimates of MI, and hence inferences about physical phenomena such as coevolution, are critically dependent on at least three prior assumptions. These assumptions are (a) how observation counts relate to expected frequencies, (b) the relationship between joint and marginal frequencies, and (c) how non-observed categories are interpreted. In any biologically-relevant data, these assumptions will affect the MI estimate as much or more-so than observed data, and are independent of uncertainty in frequency parameters. CONTACT: Andrew D.

abstract = {The standard approach for identifying gene networks is based on experimental perturbations of gene regulatory systems such as gene knock-out experiments, followed by a genome-wide profiling of differential gene expressions. However, this approach is significantly limited in that it is not possible to perturb more than one or two genes simultaneously to discover complex gene interactions or to distinguish between direct and indirect downstream regulations of the differentially-expressed genes. As an alternative, genetical genomics study has been proposed to treat naturally-occurring genetic variants as potential perturbants of gene regulatory system and to recover gene networks via analysis of population gene-expression and genotype data. Despite many advantages of genetical genomics data analysis, the computational challenge that the effects of multifactorial genetic perturbations should be decoded simultaneously from data has prevented a widespread application of genetical genomics analysis. In this article, we propose a statistical framework for learning gene networks that overcomes the limitations of experimental perturbation methods and addresses the challenges of genetical genomics analysis. We introduce a new statistical model, called a sparse conditional Gaussian graphical model, and describe an efficient learning algorithm that simultaneously decodes the perturbations of gene regulatory system by a large number of SNPs to identify a gene network along with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that perturb this network. While our statistical model captures direct genetic perturbations of gene network, by performing inference on the probabilistic graphical model, we obtain detailed characterizations of how the direct SNP perturbation effects propagate through the gene network to perturb other genes indirectly. We demonstrate our statistical method using HapMap-simulated and yeast eQTL datasets. In particular, the yeast gene network identified computationally by our method under SNP perturbations is well supported by the results from experimental perturbation studies related to DNA replication stress response.},

abstract = {We describe a comparative protein modelling method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related structures. The three-dimensional (3D) model is obtained by optimally satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions (pdfs) for the features restrained. For example, the probabilities for main-chain conformations of a modelled residue may be restrained by its residue type, main-chain conformation of an equivalent residue in a related protein, and the local similarity between the two sequences. Several such pdfs are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of homologous proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their 3D structures. The pdfs restrain C alpha-C alpha distances, main-chain N-O distances, main-chain and side-chain dihedral angles. A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse database. The 3D model of a protein is obtained by optimization of the molecular pdf such that the model violates the input restraints as little as possible. The molecular pdf is derived as a combination of pdfs restraining individual spatial features of the whole molecule. The optimization procedure is a variable target function method that applies the conjugate gradients algorithm to positions of all non-hydrogen atoms. The method is automated and is illustrated by the modelling of trypsin from two other serine proteinases.},

Simulated annealing has been used to enhance the efficiency of the LMMC loop sampling and identify low-energy loop conformations. The prediction quality is evaluated on a set of protein loops with known crystal structure that has been previously used by others to test different loop prediction methods. The results show that this approach can reproduce the experimental results with the root mean square deviation within 1.8 A for all the test cases.

abstract = {As the extent of human genetic variation becomes more fully characterized, the research community is faced with the challenging task of using this information to dissect the heritable components of complex traits. Genomewide association studies offer great promise in this respect, but their analysis poses formidable difficulties. In this article, we describe a computationally efficient approach to mining genotype-phenotype associations that scales to the size of the data sets currently being collected in such studies. We use discrete graphical models as a data-mining tool, searching for single- or multilocus patterns of association around a causative site. The approach is fully Bayesian, allowing us to incorporate prior knowledge on the spatial dependencies around each marker due to linkage disequilibrium, which reduces considerably the number of possible graphical structures. A Markov chain-Monte Carlo scheme is developed that yields samples from the posterior distribution of graphs conditional on the data from which probabilistic statements about the strength of any genotype-phenotype association can be made. Using data simulated under scenarios that vary in marker density, genotype relative risk of a causative allele, and mode of inheritance, we show that the proposed approach has better localization properties and leads to lower false-positive rates than do single-locus analyses. Finally, we present an application of our method to a quasi-synthetic data set in which data from the CYP2D6 region are embedded within simulated data on 100K single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Analysis is quick ({\textless}5 min), and we are able to localize the causative site to a very short interval.},

abstract = {Protein evolution depends on intramolecular coevolutionary networks whose complexity is proportional to the underlying functional and structural interactions among sites. Here we present a novel approach that vastly improves the sensitivity of previous methods for detecting coevolution through a weighted comparison of divergence between amino acid sites. The analysis of the HIV-1 Gag protein detected convergent adaptive coevolutionary events responsible for the selective variability emerging between subtypes. Coevolution analysis and functional data for heat-shock proteins, Hsp90 and GroEL, highlight that almost all detected coevolving sites are functionally or structurally important. The results support previous suggestions pinpointing the complex interdomain functional interactions within these proteins and we propose new amino acid sites as important for interdomain functional communication. Three-dimensional information sheds light on the functional and structural constraints governing the coevolution between sites. Our covariation analyses propose two types of coevolving sites in agreement with previous reports: pairs of sites spatially proximal, where compensatory mutations could maintain the local structure stability, and clusters of distant sites located in functional domains, suggesting a functional dependency between them. All sites detected under adaptive evolution in these proteins belong to coevolution groups, further underlining the importance of testing for coevolution in selective constraints analyses.},

abstract = {In many multivariate domains, we are interested in analyzing the dependency structure of the underlying distribution, e.g., whether two variables are in direct interaction. We can represent dependency structures using Bayesian network models. To analyze a given data set, Bayesian model selection attempts to find the most likely (MAP) model, and uses its structure to answer these questions. However, when the amount of available data is modest, there might be many models that have non-negligible posterior. Thus, we want compute the Bayesian posterior of a feature, i.e., the total posterior probability of all models that contain it. In this paper, we propose a new approach for this task. We first show how to efficiently compute a sum over the exponential number of networks that are consistent with a fixed order over network variables. This allows us to compute, for a given order, both the marginal probability of the data and the posterior of a feature. We then use this result as the basis for an algorithm that approximates the Bayesian posterior of a feature. Our approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, but over orders rather than over network structures. The space of orders is smaller and more regular than the space of structures, and has much a smoother posterior "landscape". We present empirical results on synthetic and real-life datasets that compare our approach to full model averaging (when possible), to MCMC over network structures, and to a non-Bayesian bootstrap approach.},

abstract = {Metabolic labeling experiments followed by immunoprecipitation were performed to investigate the kinetics, location and inhibitor sensitivity of degradation of both wild-type (wt) and mutant (delta F508) cystic fibrosis conductance transmembrane regulator (CFTR). At the earliest stages of the biosynthetic process, both wt and delta F508 CFTR were found to be susceptible to degradation by endogenous proteases. Virtually all delta F508 CFTR and 45-80{\%} of wt CFTR were rapidly degraded with a similar half-life (t1/2 approximately 0.5 h). The remaining wt CFTR attained a protease-resistant configuration regardless of whether traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi was operational. Metabolic energy is required for the conformational transition, but not to maintain the stability of the protease-resistant wt CFTR. Intracellular degradation of delta F508 CFTR and of incompletely folded wt CFTR occurs in a non-lysosomal, pre-Golgi compartment, as indicated by the sensitivity of proteolysis to different inhibitors and temperature. Accordingly, products of the degradation of delta F508 CFTR could be detected by immunoblotting in isolated ER, but not in the Golgi. Together, these results suggest a dynamic equilibrium between two forms of wt CFTR in the ER: an incompletely folded, protease-sensitive form which is partially converted by an ATP-dependent process to a more mature form that is protease-resistant and capable of leaving the ER. The inability delta F508 CFTR to undergo such a transition renders it susceptible to complete and rapid degradation in a pre-Golgi compartment.},

abstract = {Diverse proteins with similar structures are grouped into families of homologs and analogs, if their sequence similarity is higher or lower, respectively, than 20{\%}-30{\%}. It was suggested that protein homologs and analogs originate from a common ancestor and diverge in their distinct evolutionary time scales, emerging as a consequence of the physical properties of the protein sequence space. Although a number of studies have determined key signatures of protein family organization, the sequence-structure factors that differentiate the two evolution-related protein families remain unknown. Here, we stipulate that subtle structural changes, which appear due to accumulating mutations in the homologous families, lead to distinct packing of the protein core and, thus, novel compositions of core residues. The latter process leads to the formation of distinct families of homologs. We propose that such differentiation results in the formation of analogous families. To test our postulate, we developed a molecular modeling and design toolkit, Medusa, to computationally design protein sequences that correspond to the same fold family. We find that analogous proteins emerge when a backbone structure deviates only 1-2 angstroms root-mean-square deviation from the original structure. For close homologs, core residues are highly conserved. However, when the overall sequence similarity drops to approximately 25{\%}-30{\%}, the composition of core residues starts to diverge, thereby forming novel families of protein homologs. This direct observation of the formation of protein homologs within a specific fold family supports our hypothesis. The conservation of amino acids in designed sequences recapitulates that of the naturally occurring sequences, thereby validating our computational design methodology.},

We performed a systematic analysis of known cancer-related key interactions manually curated from published papers based on different aspects including sequence, expression and function. Known cancer-related key interactions show more miRNA binding sites (especially for 8mer binding sites), more reliable binding of miRNA to the target region, higher expression associations and broader functional coverage when compared to non-disease-related interactions. Through integrating these sequence, expression and function features, we proposed a bioinformatics approach termed PCmtI to prioritize cancer-related key interactions. Ten-fold cross-validation of our approach revealed that it can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 93.9{\%}. Subsequent leave-one-miRNA-out cross-validation also demonstrated the performance of our approach. Using miR-155 as a case, we found that the top ranked interactions can account for most functions of miR-155. In addition, we further demonstrated the power of our approach by 23 recently identified cancer-related key interactions. The approach described here offers a new way for the discovery of novel cancer-related key miRNA-target interactions.},

Most mutant nascent chains do not pass quality control in the ER, and those that do remain thermally unstable, only partially functional, and are rapidly endocytosed and degraded. Although the lack of the Phe-508 peptide backbone diminishes the NBD1 folding yield, the absence of the aromatic side chain is primarily responsible for defective CFTR assembly and channel gating. However, the site of interdomain contact by the side chain is unknown as is the high-resolution 3D structure of the complete protein. Here we present a 3D structure of CFTR, constructed by molecular modeling and supported biochemically, in which Phe-508 mediates a tertiary interaction between the surface of NBD1 and a cytoplasmic loop (CL4) in the C-terminal membrane-spanning domain (MSD2). This crucial cytoplasmic membrane interface, which is dynamically involved in regulation of channel gating, explains the known sensitivity of CFTR assembly to many disease-associated mutations in CL4 as well as NBD1 and provides a sharply focused target for small molecules to treat CF. In addition to identifying a key intramolecular site to be repaired therapeutically, our findings advance understanding of CFTR structure and function and provide a platform for focused biochemical studies of other features of this unique ABC ion channel.},

abstract = {Misfolding accounts for the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators (CFTRs), including deletion of Phe508 (DeltaF508) in the nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1). To study the role of Phe508, the de novo folding and stability of NBD1, NBD2 and CFTR were compared in conjunction with mutagenesis of Phe508. DeltaF508 and amino acid replacements that prevented CFTR folding disrupted the NBD2 fold and its native interaction with NBD1. DeltaF508 caused limited alteration in NBD1 conformation. Whereas nonpolar and some aliphatic residues were permissive, charged residues and glycine compromised the post-translational folding and stability of NBD2 and CFTR. The results suggest that hydrophobic side chain interactions of Phe508 are required for vectorial folding of NBD2 and the domain-domain assembly of CFTR, representing a combined co- and post-translational folding mechanism that may be used by other multidomain membrane proteins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) calling programs have been developed to identify Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) in next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. However, low sequencing coverage presents challenges to accurate SNV identification, especially in single-sample data. Moreover, commonly used SNP calling programs usually include several metrics in their output files for each potential SNP. These metrics are highly correlated in complex patterns, making it extremely difficult to select SNPs for further experimental validations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To explore solutions to the above challenges, we compare the performance of four SNP calling algorithm, SOAPsnp, Atlas-SNP2, SAMtools, and GATK, in a low-coverage single-sample sequencing dataset. Without any post-output filtering, SOAPsnp calls more SNVs than the other programs since it has fewer internal filtering criteria. Atlas-SNP2 has stringent internal filtering criteria; thus it reports the least number of SNVs. The numbers of SNVs called by GATK and SAMtools fall between SOAPsnp and Atlas-SNP2. Moreover, we explore the values of key metrics related to SNVs' quality in each algorithm and use them as post-output filtering criteria to filter out low quality SNVs. Under different coverage cutoff values, we compare four algorithms and calculate the empirical positive calling rate and sensitivity. Our results show that: 1) the overall agreement of the four calling algorithms is low, especially in non-dbSNPs; 2) the agreement of the four algorithms is similar when using different coverage cutoffs, except that the non-dbSNPs agreement level tends to increase slightly with increasing coverage; 3) SOAPsnp, SAMtools, and GATK have a higher empirical calling rate for dbSNPs compared to non-dbSNPs; and 4) overall, GATK and Atlas-SNP2 have a relatively higher positive calling rate and sensitivity, but GATK calls more SNVs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the agreement between different calling algorithms is relatively low. Thus, more caution should be used in choosing algorithms, setting filtering parameters, and designing validation studies. For reliable SNV calling results, we recommend that users employ more than one algorithm and use metrics related to calling quality and coverage as filtering criteria.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The identification of short insertions and deletions (indels) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from Ion Torrent and 454 reads is a challenging problem, essentially because these techniques are prone to sequence erroneously at homopolymers and can, therefore, raise indels in reads. Most of the existing mapping programs do not model homopolymer errors when aligning reads against the reference. The resulting alignments will then contain various kinds of mismatches and indels that confound the accurate determination of variant loci and alleles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To address these challenges, we realign reads against the reference using our previously proposed hidden Markov model that models homopolymer errors and then merges these pairwise alignments into a weighted alignment graph. Based on our weighted alignment graph and hidden Markov model, we develop a method called PyroHMMvar, which can simultaneously detect short indels and SNPs, as demonstrated in human resequencing data. Specifically, by applying our methods to simulated diploid datasets, we demonstrate that PyroHMMvar produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods, such as Samtools and GATK, and is less sensitive to mapping parameter settings than the other methods. We also apply PyroHMMvar to analyze one human whole genome resequencing dataset, and the results confirm that PyroHMMvar predicts SNPs and indels accurately.

More precisely---taking into account that the conjecture lacks any precise formulation yet---first we make sense of what one would mean by a "generic counterexample" by introducing the mathematically unambigous and logically stronger concept of a "robust counterexample". Then making use of Penrose' nonlinear graviton construction (i.e., twistor theory) and a Wick rotation trick we construct a smooth Ricci-flat but not flat Lorentzian metric on the largest member of the Gompf--Taubes uncountable radial family of large exotic {\$}{\{}\backslashmathbb R{\}}{\^{}}4{\$}'s. We observe that this solution of the Lorentzian vacuum Einstein's equations with vanishing cosmological constant provides us with a sort of counterexample which is weaker than a "robust counterexample" but still reasonable to consider as a "generic counterexample". It is interesting that this kind of counterexample exists only in four dimensions.},

In this paper, we present a model based on such covariations in protein sequences in which the pairs of residues that have mutual influence combine to produce a system analogous to a Hopfield neural network. The emergent properties of such a network, such as soft failure and the connection between network architecture and stored memory, have close parallels in known proteins. This model suggests that an explanation for observed characters of proteins such as the diminution of function by substitutions distant from the active site, the existence of protein folds (superfolds) that can perform several functions based on one architecture, and structural and functional resilience to destabilizing substitutions might derive from their inherent network-like structure. This model may also provide a basis for mapping the relationship between structure, function and evolutionary history of a protein family, and thus be a powerful tool for rational engineering.},

Here, we resolve successive motions of the initiating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the initiation involving a transient clamp closure as a prerequisite for DNA melting. We also present a 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of a late-initiation intermediate harboring a rotationally unconstrained downstream DNA duplex within the open RNAP active site cleft.

abstract = {Random mutations under neutral or near-neutral conditions are studied by considering plausible evolutionary trajectories on "neutral nets"-i.e., collections of sequences (genotypes) interconnected via single-point mutations encoding for the same ground-state structure (phenotype). We use simple exact lattice models for the mapping between sequence and conformational spaces. Densities of states based on model intrachain interactions are determined by exhaustive conformational enumeration. We compare results from two very different interaction schemes to ascertain robustness of the conclusions. In both models, sequences in a majority of neutral nets center around a single "prototype sequence" of maximum mutational stability, tolerating the largest number of neutral mutations. General analytical considerations show that these topologies by themselves lead to higher steady-state evolutionary populations at prototype sequences. On average, native thermodynamic stability increases toward a maximum at the prototype sequence, resulting in funnel-like arrangements of native stabilities in sequence space. These observations offer a unified perspective on sequence design, native stability, and mutational stability of proteins. These principles are generalizable from native stability to any measure of fitness provided that its variation with respect to mutations is essentially smooth.},

abstract = {P-type ATPases pump ions across membranes, generating steep electrochemical gradients that are essential for the function of all cells. Access to the ion-binding sites within the pumps alternates between the two sides of the membrane to avoid the dissipation of the gradients that would occur during simultaneous access. In Na(+),K(+)-ATPase pumps treated with the marine agent palytoxin, this strict alternation is disrupted and binding sites are sometimes simultaneously accessible from both sides of the membrane, transforming the pumps into ion channels (see, for example, refs 2, 3). Current recordings in these channels can monitor accessibility of introduced cysteine residues to water-soluble sulphydryl-specific reagents. We found previously that Na(+),K(+) pump-channels open to the extracellular surface through a deep and wide vestibule that emanates from a narrower pathway between transmembrane helices 4 and 6 (TM4 and TM6). Here we report that cysteine scans from TM1 to TM6 reveal a single unbroken cation pathway that traverses palytoxin-bound Na(+),K(+) pump-channels from one side of the membrane to the other. This pathway comprises residues from TM1, TM2, TM4 and TM6, passes through ion-binding site II, and is probably conserved in structurally and evolutionarily related P-type pumps, such as sarcoplasmic- and endoplasmic-reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases and H(+),K(+)-ATPases.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic inference from amino acid sequence data uses mainly empirical models of amino acid replacement and is therefore dependent on those models. Two of the more widely used models, the Dayhoff and JTT models, are estimated using similar methods that can utilize large numbers of sequences from many unrelated protein families but are somewhat unsatisfactory because they rely on assumptions that may lead to systematic error and discard a large amount of the information within the sequences. The alternative method of maximum-likelihood estimation may utilize the information in the sequence data more efficiently and suffers from no systematic error, but it has previously been applicable to relatively few sequences related by a single phylogenetic tree. Here, we combine the best attributes of these two methods using an approximate maximum-likelihood method. We implemented this approach to estimate a new model of amino acid replacement from a database of globular protein sequences comprising 3,905 amino acid sequences split into 182 protein families. While the new model has an overall structure similar to those of other commonly used models, there are significant differences. The new model outperforms the Dayhoff and JTT models with respect to maximum-likelihood values for a large majority of the protein families in our database. This suggests that it provides a better overall fit to the evolutionary process in globular proteins and may lead to more accurate phylogenetic tree estimates. Potentially, this matrix, and the methods used to generate it, may also be useful in other areas of research, such as biological sequence database searching, sequence alignment, and protein structure prediction, for which an accurate description of amino acid replacement is required.},

One study recently completed the first comprehensive dissection of transcriptional regulation in budding yeast, giving a detailed glimpse of a genome-wide survey of the genetics of gene expression. Unlike classical quantitative traits, which often represent gross clinical measurements that may be far removed from the biological processes giving rise to them, the genetic linkages associated with transcript abundance affords a closer look at cellular biochemical processes. Here we describe comprehensive genetic screens of mouse, plant and human transcriptomes by considering gene expression values as quantitative traits.

SNAP-25 contributes two helices to the complex and is targeted to the plasma membrane by palmitoylation of four cysteines in the linker region. It is alternatively spliced into two forms, SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b, differing by nine amino acids substitutions. When expressed in chromaffin cells from SNAP-25 null mice, the isoforms support different levels of secretion. Here, we investigated the basis of that different secretory phenotype. We found that two nonconservative substitutions in the N-terminal SNARE domain and not the different localization of one palmitoylated cysteine cause the functional difference between the isoforms. Biochemical and molecular dynamic simulation experiments revealed that the two substitutions do not regulate secretion by affecting the property of SNARE complex itself, but rather make the SNAP-25b-containing SNARE complex more available for the interaction with accessory factor(s).},

We hypothesized that deleterious DNMs may play a role in cases of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), two etiologically heterogeneous disorders with significantly reduced reproductive fitness. We present a direct measure of the de novo mutation rate (??) and selective constraints from DNMs estimated from a deep resequencing data set generated from a large cohort of ASD and SCZ cases (n = 285) and population control individuals (n = 285) with available parental DNA.

Our calculated direct neutral mutation rate (1.36 ?? 10-8) is similar to previous indirect estimates, but we observed a significant excess of potentially deleterious DNMs in ASD and SCZ individuals.

The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rapid development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology provides a novel avenue for genomic exploration and research. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) inferred from next generation sequencing are expected to reveal gene mutations in cancer. However, NGS has lower sequence coverage and poor SNVs detection capability in the regulatory regions of the genome. Post probabilistic based methods are efficient for detection of SNVs in high coverage regions or sequencing data with high depth. However, for data with low sequencing depth, the efficiency of such algorithms remains poor and needs to be improved.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A new tool SNVHMM basing on a discrete hidden Markov model (HMM) was developed to infer the genotype for each position on the genome. We incorporated the mapping quality of each read and the corresponding base quality on the reads into the emission probability of HMM. The context information of the whole observation as well as its confidence were completely utilized to infer the genotype for each position on the genome in study. Therefore, more probability power can be gained over the Bayes based methods, which is very useful for SNVs detection for data with low sequencing depth. Moreover, our model was verified by testing against two sets of lobular breast tumor and Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) data each. Comparing against a recently published SNVs calling algorithm SNVMix2, our model improved the performance of SNVMix2 largely when the sequencing depth is low and also outperformed SNVMix2 when SNVMix2 is well trained by large datasets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: SNVHMM can detect SNVs from NGS cancer data efficiently even if the sequence depth is very low. The training data size can be very small for SNVHMM to work. SNVHMM incorporated the base quality and mapping quality of all observed bases and reads, and also provides the option for users to choose the confidence of the observation for SNVs prediction.},

abstract = {Drug repositioning, an innovative therapeutic application of an old drug, has received much attention as a particularly costeffective strategy in drug R{\&}D Recent work has indicated that repositioning can be promoted by utilizing a wide range of information sources, including medicinal chemical, target, mechanism, main and side-effect-related information, and also bibliometric and taxonomical fingerprints, signatures and knowledge bases. This article describes the adaptation of a conceptually novel, more efficient approach for the identification of new possible therapeutic applications of approved drugs and drug candidates, based on a kernel-based data fusion method. This strategy includes (1) the potentially multiple representation of information sources, (2) the automated weighting and statistically optimal combination of information sources, and (3) the automated weighting of parts of the query compounds. The performance was systematically evaluated by using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System classes in a cross-validation framework. The results confirmed that kernel-based data fusion can integrate heterogeneous information sources significantly better than standard rank-based fusion can, and this method provides a unique solution for repositioning; it can also be utilized for de novo drug discovery. The advantages of kernel-based data fusion are illustrated with examples and open problems that are particularly relevant for pharmaceutical applications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are a widely used tool for protein family research. Up to now, however, there exists no method to visualize all of their central aspects graphically in an intuitively understandable way. RESULTS: We present a visualization method that incorporates both emission and transition probabilities of the pHMM, thus extending sequence logos introduced by Schneider and Stephens. For each emitting state of the pHMM, we display a stack of letters. The stack height is determined by the deviation of the position's letter emission frequencies from the background frequencies. The stack width visualizes both the probability of reaching the state (the hitting probability) and the expected number of letters the state emits during a pass through the model (the state's expected contribution).A web interface offering online creation of HMM Logos and the corresponding source code can be found at the Logos web server of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics http://logos.molgen.mpg.de. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that HMM Logos can be a useful tool for the biologist: We use them to highlight differences between two homologous subfamilies of GTPases, Rab and Ras, and we show that they are able to indicate structural elements of Ras.},

The search for such subsets is a computationally complex task. We present an algorithm, based on iterative clustering, that performs such a search. This analysis is especially suitable for gene microarray data, where the contributions of a variety of biological mechanisms to the gene expression levels are entangled in a large body of experimental data. The method was applied to two gene microarray data sets, on colon cancer and leukemia. By identifying relevant subsets of the data and focusing on them we were able to discover partitions and correlations that were masked and hidden when the full dataset was used in the analysis. Some of these partitions have clear biological interpretation; others can serve to identify possible directions for future research.},

abstract = {In each normal Na,K pump cycle, first three sodium and then two potassium ions are transported; in both cases, the ions become temporarily occluded in pump conformations that isolate them from internal and external solutions. A major charge movement occurs during sodium translocation and accompanies the deocclusion of sodium ions or their release to the cell exterior, or both. The nature of the charge movement was examined by measurement of the undirectional sodium-22 efflux mediated by Nai-Nao exchange (Nai and Nao are internal and external sodium ions) in voltage-clamped, internally dialyzed squid giant axons in the absence of potassium; in this way the pump activity was restricted to the sodium-translocation pathway. Although electroneutral, the Nai-Nao exchange was nevertheless voltage-sensitive: increasingly negative potentials enhanced its rate along a saturating sigmoid curve. Such voltage dependence demonstrates that the release and rebinding of external sodium is the predominant charge-moving (hence, voltage-sensitive) step, suggesting that extracellular sodium ions must reach their binding sites deep in the pump molecule through a high-field access channel. This implies that part of the pump molecule is functionally analogous to an ion channel.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous associations between genetic loci and individual phenotypes; however, relatively few GWAS have attempted to detect pleiotropic associations, in which loci are simultaneously associated with multiple distinct phenotypes. We show that pleiotropic associations can be directly modeled via the construction of simple Bayesian networks, and that these models can be applied to produce single or ensembles of Bayesian classifiers that leverage pleiotropy to improve genetic risk prediction. The proposed method includes two phases: (1) Bayesian model comparison, to identify Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with one or more traits; and (2) cross-validation feature selection, in which a final set of SNPs is selected to optimize prediction. To demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of the method, a total of 1600 case-control GWAS datasets with two dichotomous phenotypes were simulated under 16 scenarios, varying the association strengths of causal SNPs, the size of the discovery sets, the balance between cases and controls, and the number of pleiotropic causal SNPs. Across the 16 scenarios, prediction accuracy varied from 90 to 50{\%}. In the 14 scenarios that included pleiotropically associated SNPs, the pleiotropic model search and prediction methods consistently outperformed the naive model search and prediction. In the two scenarios in which there were no true pleiotropic SNPs, the differences between the pleiotropic and naive model searches were minimal. To further evaluate the method on real data, a discovery set of 1071 sickle cell disease (SCD) patients was used to search for pleiotropic associations between cerebral vascular accidents and fetal hemoglobin level. Classification was performed on a smaller validation set of 352 SCD patients, and showed that the inclusion of pleiotropic SNPs may slightly improve prediction, although the difference was not statistically significant. The proposed method is robust, computationally efficient, and provides a powerful new approach for detecting and modeling pleiotropic disease loci.},

To gain insight about the neurobiology of TCF4, we created an in vivo model of PTHS by suppressing Tcf4 expression in rat prefrontal neurons immediately prior to neurogenesis. This cell-autonomous genetic insult attenuated neuronal spiking by increasing the afterhyperpolarization. At the molecular level, using a novel technique called iTRAP that combined in utero electroporation and translating ribosome affinity purification, we identified increased translation of two ion channel genes, Kcnq1 and Scn10a. These ion channel candidates were validated by pharmacological rescue and molecular phenocopy. Remarkably, similar excitability deficits were observed in prefrontal neurons from a Tcf4(+/tr) mouse model of PTHS. Thus, we identify TCF4 as a regulator of neuronal intrinsic excitability in part by repression of Kcnq1 and Scn10a and suggest that this molecular function may underlie pathophysiology associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Cancer progression is driven by the accumulation of a small number of genetic alterations. However, these few driver alterations reside in a cancer genome alongside tens of thousands of additional mutations termed passengers. Passengers are widely believed to have no role in cancer, yet many passengers fall within protein-coding genes and other functional elements that can have potentially deleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate the potential of moderately deleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic progression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer progression with an analysis of cancer sequencing data. From simulations, we find that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural selection during progression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers alters the course of progression, leading to several oncological phenomena that are hard to explain with a traditional driver-centric view. We then tested the predictions of our model using cancer genomics data and confirmed that many passengers are likely damaging and have largely evaded negative selection. Finally, we use our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either (i) increasing the mutation rate or (ii) exacerbating their deleterious effects. Though both approaches lead to cancer regression, the latter is a more effective therapy. Our results suggest a unique framework for understanding cancer progression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.},

An underappreciated point is that MLMA can also increase power in studies without sample structure by implicitly conditioning on associated loci other than the candidate locus. Numerous variations on the standard MLMA approach have recently been published, with a focus on reducing computational cost. These advances provide researchers applying MLMA methods with many options to choose from, but we caution that MLMA methods are still subject to potential pitfalls.

We analyzed the raw data using near-default parameters with five different alignment and variant-calling pipelines (SOAP, BWA-GATK, BWA-SNVer, GNUMAP, and BWA-SAMtools). We additionally sequenced a single whole genome using the sequencing and analysis pipeline from Complete Genomics (CG), with 95{\%} of the exome region being covered by 20 or more reads per base. Finally, we validated 919 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 841 insertions and deletions (indels), including similar fractions of GATK-only, SOAP-only, and shared calls, on the MiSeq platform by amplicon sequencing with approximately 5000X mean coverage.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: SNV concordance between five Illumina pipelines across all 15 exomes was 57.4{\%}, while 0.5 to 5.1{\%} of variants were called as unique to each pipeline. Indel concordance was only 26.8{\%} between three indel-calling pipelines, even after left-normalizing and intervalizing genomic coordinates by 20 base pairs. There were 11{\%} of CG variants falling within targeted regions in exome sequencing that were not called by any of the Illumina-based exome analysis pipelines.

Despite the rich literature in coevolutionary sequence analysis, previous methods often have to trade off between generality, simplicity, phylogenetic information, and specific knowledge about interactions. Furthermore, despite the evidence of coevolution in selected protein families, a comprehensive screening of coevolution among all protein domains is still lacking. We propose an augmented continuous-time Markov process model for sequence coevolution. The model can handle different types of interactions, incorporate phylogenetic information and sequence substitution, has only one extra free parameter, and requires no knowledge about interaction rules. We employ this model to large-scale screenings on the entire protein domain database (Pfam). Strikingly, with 0.1 trillion tests executed, the majority of the inferred coevolving protein domains are functionally related, and the coevolving amino acid residues are spatially coupled. Moreover, many of the coevolving positions are located at functionally important sites of proteins/protein complexes, such as the subunit linkers of superoxide dismutase, the tRNA binding sites of ribosomes, the DNA binding region of RNA polymerase, and the active and ligand binding sites of various enzymes. The results suggest sequence coevolution manifests structural and functional constraints of proteins. The intricate relations between sequence coevolution and various selective constraints are worth pursuing at a deeper level.},

abstract = {MicroRNA profiling represents an important first-step in deducting individual RNA-based regulatory function in a cell, tissue, or at a specific developmental stage. Currently there are several different platforms to choose from in order to make the initial miRNA profiles. In this study we investigate recently developed digital microRNA high-throughput technologies. Four different platforms were compared including next generation SOLiD ligation sequencing and Illumina HiSeq sequencing, hybridization-based NanoString nCounter, and miRCURY locked nucleic acid RT-qPCR. For all four technologies, full microRNA profiles were generated from human cell lines that represent noninvasive and invasive tumorigenic breast cancer. This study reports the correlation between platforms, as well as a more extensive analysis of the accuracy and sensitivity of data generated when using different platforms and important consideration when verifying results by the use of additional technologies. We found all the platforms to be highly capable for microRNA analysis. Furthermore, the two NGS platforms and RT-qPCR all have equally high sensitivity, and the fold change accuracy is independent of individual miRNA concentration for NGS and RT-qPCR. Based on these findings we propose new guidelines and considerations when performing microRNA profiling.},

abstract = {The predicted effect of effective population size on the distribution of fitness effects and substitution rate is critically dependent on the relationship between sequence and fitness. This highlights the importance of using models that are informed by the molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysics of the evolving systems. We describe a computational model based on fundamental aspects of biophysics, the requirement for (most) proteins to be thermodynamically stable. Using this model, we find that differences in population size have minimal impact on the distribution of population-scaled fitness effects, as well as on the rate of molecular evolution. This is because larger populations result in selection for more stable proteins that are less affected by mutations. This reduction in the magnitude of the fitness effects almost exactly cancels the greater selective pressure resulting from the larger population size. Conversely, changes in the population size in either direction cause transient increases in the substitution rate. As differences in population size often correspond to changes in population size, this makes comparisons of substitution rates in different lineages difficult to interpret.},

In this study, we analysed the association of TA and the expression of telomerase RNA (TR) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in 23 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) (17 high grade and 6 low grade tumors), 11 plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) and 6 dermal neurofibro- mas (DNF). TA was studied using telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay and expression of TR and TERT was investigated using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR. TA was detected in 14 out of 17 (82{\%}) high grade MPNST, whereas all 6 low grade MPNSTand 17 benign tumors were telomerase negative. The TERT transcripts were detected in all high grade MPNST, 50{\%} of the low grade MPNST, and 4 benign tumors. However, the expression level of the TERT strik- ingly correlated with TA and high grade MPNST. Thus, while TERTexpression was similar in both low grade MPNSTand PNF (P 5 0.115), it was significantly higher in high grade MPNSTwhen compared to either low grade MPNST (P 5 0.042), PNF (P 5 0.001) or DNF tumors (P 5 0.010). These findings indicate that TA and expression level of TERTare potential markers for high grade malignancy in NF1 patients.

abstract = {Over the past two decades, Xenopus laevis oocytes have been widely used as an expression system to investigate both physiological and pathological properties of membrane proteins such as channels and transporters. Past studies have clearly shown the key implications of mistargeting in relation to the pathogenesis of these proteins. To unambiguously determine the plasma membrane targeting of a protein, a thorough purification technique becomes essential. Unfortunately, available techniques are either too cumbersome, technically demanding, or require large amounts of material, all of which are not adequate when using oocytes individually injected with cRNA or DNA. In this article, we present a new technique that permits excellent purification of plasma membranes from X. laevis oocytes. This technique is fast, does not require particular skills such as peeling of vitelline membrane, and permits purification of multiple samples from as few as 10 and up to {\textgreater}100 oocytes. The procedure combines partial digestion of the vitelline membrane, polymerization of the plasma membrane, and low-speed centrifugations. We have validated this technique essentially with Western blot assays on three plasma membrane proteins [aquaporin (AQP)2, Na(+)-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)1, and transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV)5], using both wild-type and mistargeted forms of the proteins. Purified plasma membrane fractions were easily collected, and samples were found to be adequate for Western blot identification.},

abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90{\%} of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25{\%} of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1{\%} of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24{\%} is in introns, with 75{\%} of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1{\%} of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are a class of small RNAs known to regulate gene expression at the transcript level, the protein level, or both. Since microRNA binding is sequence-based but possibly structure-specific, work in this area has resulted in multiple databases storing predicted microRNA:target relationships computed using diverse algorithms. We integrate prediction databases, compare predictions to in vitro data, and use cross-database predictions to model the microRNA:transcript interactome--referred to as the micronome--to study microRNA involvement in well-known signalling pathways as well as associations with disease. We make this data freely available with a flexible user interface as our microRNA Data Integration Portal--mirDIP (http://ophid.utoronto.ca/mirDIP).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: mirDIP integrates prediction databases to elucidate accurate microRNA:target relationships. Using NAViGaTOR to produce interaction networks implicating microRNAs in literature-based, KEGG-based and Reactome-based pathways, we find these signalling pathway networks have significantly more microRNA involvement compared to chance (p{\textless}0.05), suggesting microRNAs co-target many genes in a given pathway. Further examination of the micronome shows two distinct classes of microRNAs; universe microRNAs, which are involved in many signalling pathways; and intra-pathway microRNAs, which target multiple genes within one signalling pathway. We find universe microRNAs to have more targets (p{\textless}0.0001), to be more studied (p{\textless}0.0002), and to have higher degree in the KEGG cancer pathway (p{\textless}0.0001), compared to intra-pathway microRNAs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our pathway-based analysis of mirDIP data suggests microRNAs are involved in intra-pathway signalling. We identify two distinct classes of microRNAs, suggesting a hierarchical organization of microRNAs co-targeting genes both within and between pathways, and implying differential involvement of universe and intra-pathway microRNAs at the disease level.},

Array comparative genomic hybridization has been used widely to identify CNVs genome wide, but the next-generation sequencing technology provides an opportunity to characterize CNVs genome wide with unprecedented resolution. In this study, we developed an algorithm to detect CNVs from whole-genome sequencing data and applied it to a newly sequenced glioblastoma genome with a matched control. This read-depth algorithm, called BIC-seq, can accurately and efficiently identify CNVs via minimizing the Bayesian information criterion. Using BIC-seq, we identified hundreds of CNVs as small as 40 bp in the cancer genome sequenced at 10× coverage, whereas we could only detect large CNVs ({\textgreater} 15 kb) in the array comparative genomic hybridization profiles for the same genome. Eighty percent (14/16) of the small variants tested (110 bp to 14 kb) were experimentally validated by quantitative PCR, demonstrating high sensitivity and true positive rate of the algorithm. We also extended the algorithm to detect recurrent CNVs in multiple samples as well as deriving error bars for breakpoints using a Gibbs sampling approach. We propose this statistical approach as a principled yet practical and efficient method to estimate CNVs in whole-genome sequencing data.},

abstract = {Synaptotagmins comprise a large protein family, of which synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) is a Ca2+ sensor for fast exocytosis, and its close relative, synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2), is assumed to serve similar functions. Chromaffin cells express Syt1 but not Syt2. We compared secretion from chromaffin cells from Syt1 null mice overexpressing either Syt isoform. High time-resolution capacitance measurement showed that Syt1 null cells lack the exocytotic phase corresponding to the readily-releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles. Comparison with the amperometric signal confirmed that the missing phase of exocytosis consists of catecholamine-containing vesicles. Overexpression of Syt1 rescued the RRP and increased its size above wild-type values, whereas the size of the slowly releasable pool decreased, indicating that the availability of Syt1 regulates the relative size of the two releasable pools. The RRP was also rescued by Syt2 overexpression, but the kinetics of fusion was slightly slower than in cells expressing Syt1. Biochemical experiments showed that Syt2 has a slightly lower Ca2+ affinity for phospholipid binding than Syt1 because of a difference in the C2A domain. These data constitute evidence for the function of Syt1 and Syt2 as alternative, but not identical, calcium-sensors for RRP fusion. By overexpression of Syt1 mutated in the shared PKC/calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase phosphorylation site, we show that phorbol esters act independently and upstream of Syt1 to regulate the size of the releasable pools. We conclude that exocytosis from mouse chromaffin cells can be modified by the differential expression of Syt isoforms and by Syt abundance but not by phosphorylation of Syt1.},

abstract = {Biochemical activity and core stability are essential properties of proteins, maintained usually by conserved amino acids. Structural dynamics emerged in recent years as another essential aspect of protein functionality. Structural dynamics enable the adaptation of the protein to binding substrates and to undergo allosteric transitions, while maintaining the native fold. Key residues that mediate structural dynamics would thus be expected to be conserved, or exhibit co-evolutionary patterns at least. Yet, the correlation between sequence evolution and structural dynamics is yet to be established. With recent advances in efficient characterization of structural dynamics, we are now in a position to perform a systematic analysis. In the present study, a set of 34 enzymes representing various folds and functional classes is analyzed using information theory and elastic network models. Our analysis shows that the structural regions distinguished by their co-evolution propensity as well as high mobility are predisposed to serve as substrate recognition sites; whereas residues acting as global hinges during collective dynamics are often supported by conserved residues. We propose a mobility scale for different types of amino acids, which tends to vary inversely with amino acid conservation. Our findings suggest the balance between physical adaptability (enabled by structure-encoded motions) and chemical specificity (conferred by correlated amino acid substitutions) underlies the selection of a relatively small set of versatile folds by proteins.},

Therefore, characterization of the retention and attempts to rescue the mutant CFTR are a major focus of CF research. Earlier, we had shown that four arginine-framed tripeptide (AFT) signals in CFTR participate in the quality control. Now we have mutated these four AFTs in all possible combinations and found that simultaneous inactivation of two of them (R29K and R555K) is necessary and sufficient to overcome F508del CFTR retention. Immunofluorescence staining of BHK cells expressing this variant indicates that it matures and is routed to the plasma membrane. Acquisition of at least some wild-type structure was detected in the pattern of proteolytic digestion fragments. Functional activity at the cell surface was evident in chloride efflux assays. However, single channel activity of the rescued mutant measured in planar lipid bilayers diminished as temperature was increased from 30 to 37 degrees C. These findings support the idea that absence of Phe 508 causes not only a kinetic folding defect but also steady-state structural instability. Therefore effective molecular therapies developed to alleviate disease caused by F508del and probably other misprocessing mutants will require overcoming both their kinetic and steady-state impacts.},

abstract = {SNPs discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) account for only a small fraction of the genetic variation of complex traits in human populations. Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45{\%} of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

Alternative splicing potentially generates 38,016 isoforms differing in their extracellular Ig and transmembrane domains. We demonstrate that Dscam mediates the sorting of axons in the developing mushroom body (MB). This correlates with the precise spatiotemporal pattern of Dscam protein expression. We demonstrate that MB neurons express different arrays of Dscam isoforms and that single MB neurons express multiple isoforms. Two different Dscam isoforms differing in their extracellular domains introduced as transgenes into single mutant cells partially rescued the mutant phenotype. Expression of one isoform of Dscam in a cohort of MB neurons induced dominant phenotypes, while expression of a single isoform in a single cell did not. We propose that different extracellular domains of Dscam share a common function and that differences in isoforms expressed on the surface of neighboring axons influence interactions between them.},

We examined two fundamental processes in protein dynamics--protein folding and conformational change within the folded state--by means of extremely long all-atom MD simulations conducted on a special-purpose machine. Equilibrium simulations of a WW protein domain captured multiple folding and unfolding events that consistently follow a well-defined folding pathway; separate simulations of the protein's constituent substructures shed light on possible determinants of this pathway. A 1-millisecond simulation of the folded protein BPTI reveals a small number of structurally distinct conformational states whose reversible interconversion is slower than local relaxations within those states by a factor of more than 1000.},

The method is based on algorithms generating mathematical representations directly from DNA/RNA or protein sequences, followed by the output of numerical (scalar or vector) and visual characteristics (graphs). The binary encoded sequence information is transformed into a compact analytical form, called the Iterative Canonical Form (or ICF) of Boolean functions, which can then be used as a generalized molecular descriptor. The method provides raw vector data for calculating different distance matrices, which in turn can be analyzed by neighbor-joining or UPGMA to derive a tree, or by principal coordinates analysis to get an ordination scattergram. The new method and the associated software for inferring phylogenetic trees are called the Boolean analysis or BOOL-AN. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Quantitative analyses of biological sequences generally proceed under the assumption that individual DNA or protein sequence elements vary independently. However, this assumption is not biologically realistic because sequence elements often vary in a concerted manner resulting from common ancestry and structural or functional constraints. We calculated intersite associations among aligned protein sequences by using mutual information. To discriminate associations resulting from common ancestry from those resulting from structural or functional constraints, we used a parametric bootstrap algorithm to construct replicate data sets. These data are expected to have intersite associations resulting solely from phylogeny. By comparing the distribution of our association statistic for the replicate data against that calculated for empirical data, we were able to assign a probability that two sites covaried resulting from structural or functional constraint rather than phylogeny. We tested our method by using an alignment of 237 basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein domains. Comparison of our results against a solved three-dimensional structure confirmed the identification of several sites important to function and structure of the bHLH domain. This analytical procedure has broad utility as a first step in the identification of sites that are important to biological macromolecular structure and function when a solved structure is unavailable.},

abstract = {Although probabilistic models of genotype (e.g., DNA sequence) evolution have been greatly elaborated, less attention has been paid to the effect of phenotype on the evolution of the genotype. Here we propose an evolutionary model and a Bayesian inference procedure that are aimed at filling this gap. In the model, RNA secondary structure links genotype and phenotype by treating the approximate free energy of a sequence folded into a secondary structure as a surrogate for fitness. The underlying idea is that a nucleotide substitution resulting in a more stable secondary structure should have a higher rate than a substitution that yields a less stable secondary structure. This free energy approach incorporates evolutionary dependencies among sequence positions beyond those that are reflected simply by jointly modeling change at paired positions in an RNA helix. Although there is not a formal requirement with this approach that secondary structure be known and nearly invariant over evolutionary time, computational considerations make these assumptions attractive and they have been adopted in a software program that permits statistical analysis of multiple homologous sequences that are related via a known phylogenetic tree topology. Analyses of 5S ribosomal RNA sequences are presented to illustrate and quantify the strong impact that RNA secondary structure has on substitution rates. Analyses on simulated sequences show that the new inference procedure has reasonable statistical properties. Potential applications of this procedure, including improved ancestral sequence inference and location of functionally interesting sites, are discussed.},

SVMs use two key concepts to solve this problem: large margin separation and kernel functions. The idea of large margin separation can be moti- vated by classification of points in two dimensions (see Figure 1). A simple way to classify the points is to draw a straight line and call points lying on one side positive and on the other side negative. If the two sets are well separated, one would intui- tively draw the separating line such that it is as far as possible away from the points in both sets (see Figures 2 and 3). This intuitive choice captures the idea of large margin separation, which is mathematically formulated in the section Classification with Large Margin.},

@article{DelaGarza2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reproducibility is one of the tenets of the scientific method. Scientific experiments often comprise complex data flows, selection of adequate parameters, and analysis and visualization of intermediate and end results. Breaking down the complexity of such experiments into the joint collaboration of small, repeatable, well defined tasks, each with well defined inputs, parameters, and outputs, offers the immediate benefit of identifying bottlenecks, pinpoint sections which could benefit from parallelization, among others. Workflows rest upon the notion of splitting complex work into the joint effort of several manageable tasks. There are several engines that give users the ability to design and execute workflows. Each engine was created to address certain problems of a specific community, therefore each one has its advantages and shortcomings. Furthermore, not all features of all workflow engines are royalty-free -an aspect that could potentially drive away members of the scientific community.

RESULTS: We have developed a set of tools that enables the scientific community to benefit from workflow interoperability. We developed a platform-free structured representation of parameters, inputs, outputs of command-line tools in so-called Common Tool Descriptor documents. We have also overcome the shortcomings and combined the features of two royalty-free workflow engines with a substantial user community: the Konstanz Information Miner, an engine which we see as a formidable workflow editor, and the Grid and User Support Environment, a web-based framework able to interact with several high-performance computing resources. We have thus created a free and highly accessible way to design workflows on a desktop computer and execute them on high-performance computing resources.

CONCLUSIONS: Our work will not only reduce time spent on designing scientific workflows, but also make executing workflows on remote high-performance computing resources more accessible to technically inexperienced users. We strongly believe that our efforts not only decrease the turnaround time to obtain scientific results but also have a positive impact on reproducibility, thus elevating the quality of obtained scientific results.},

abstract = {Analyses investigating low frequency variants have the potential for explaining additional genetic heritability of many complex human traits. However, the natural frequencies of rare variation between human populations strongly confound genetic analyses. We have applied a novel collapsing method to identify biological features with low frequency variant burden differences in thirteen populations sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project. Our flexible collapsing tool utilizes expert biological knowledge from multiple publicly available database sources to direct feature selection. Variants were collapsed according to genetically driven features, such as evolutionary conserved regions, regulatory regions genes, and pathways. We have conducted an extensive comparison of low frequency variant burden differences (MAF{\textless}0.03) between populations from 1000 Genomes Project Phase I data. We found that on average 26.87{\%} of gene bins, 35.47{\%} of intergenic bins, 42.85{\%} of pathway bins, 14.86{\%} of ORegAnno regulatory bins, and 5.97{\%} of evolutionary conserved regions show statistically significant differences in low frequency variant burden across populations from the 1000 Genomes Project. The proportion of bins with significant differences in low frequency burden depends on the ancestral similarity of the two populations compared and types of features tested. Even closely related populations had notable differences in low frequency burden, but fewer differences than populations from different continents. Furthermore, conserved or functionally relevant regions had fewer significant differences in low frequency burden than regions under less evolutionary constraint. This degree of low frequency variant differentiation across diverse populations and feature elements highlights the critical importance of considering population stratification in the new era of DNA sequencing and low frequency variant genomic analyses.},

abstract = {The chloride ion channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) displays a typical adenosine trisphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) protein architecture comprising two transmembrane domains, two intracellular nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a unique intracellular regulatory domain. Once phosphorylated in the regulatory domain, CFTR channels can open and close when supplied with cytosolic ATP. Despite the general agreement that formation of a head-to-tail NBD dimer drives the opening of the chloride ion pore, little is known about how ATP binding to individual NBDs promotes subsequent formation of this stable dimer. Structural studies on isolated NBDs suggest that ATP binding induces an intra-domain conformational change termed "induced fit," which is required for subsequent dimerization. We investigated the allosteric interaction between three residues within NBD2 of CFTR, F1296, N1303, and R1358, because statistical coupling analysis suggests coevolution of these positions, and because in crystal structures of ABC domains, interactions between these positions appear to be modulated by ATP binding. We expressed wild-type as well as F1296S, N1303Q, and R1358A mutant CFTR in Xenopus oocytes and studied these channels using macroscopic inside-out patch recordings. Thermodynamic mutant cycles were built on several kinetic parameters that characterize individual steps in the gating cycle, such as apparent affinities for ATP, open probabilities in the absence of ATP, open probabilities in saturating ATP in a mutant background (K1250R), which precludes ATP hydrolysis, as well as the rates of nonhydrolytic closure. Our results suggest state-dependent changes in coupling between two of the three positions (1296 and 1303) and are consistent with a model that assumes a toggle switch-like interaction pattern during the intra-NBD2 induced fit in response to ATP binding. Stabilizing interactions of F1296 and N1303 present before ATP binding are replaced by a single F1296-N1303 contact in ATP-bound states, with similar interaction partner toggling occurring during the much rarer ATP-independent spontaneous openings.},

We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction.

These subtle changes of DNA sequence can influence the susceptibility to various pathologies including cancer. The functional meaning of SNPs is not always clear, being, the majority of them, localized in noncoding regions. The discovery of microRNAs, tiny noncoding RNAs able to bind the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target genes and to consequently downregulate their expression, has provided a functional explanation of how some SNPs positioned in noncoding regions contribute to cancer susceptibility. In this paper we summarize the current knowledge of the effect on cancer susceptibility of SNPs included in regions related with miRNA-dependent pathways. Hereditary cancer comes up from mutations that occur in high-penetrant predisposing tumor genes. However, a considerable part of inherited cancers arises from multiple low-penetrant predisposing gene variants that influence the behavior of cancer insurgence. Despite the established significance of such polymorphic variants in cancer predisposition, sometimes their functional role remains unknown. The discovery of a new group of genes called microRNAs (miRNAs) opened an avenue for the functional interpretation of polymorphisms involved in cancer predisposition.},

abstract = {During tumor initiation and progression, cancer cells acquire a selective advantage, allowing them to outcompete their normal counterparts. Identification of the genetic changes that underlie these tumor acquired traits can provide deeper insights into the biology of tumorigenesis. Regions of copy number alterations and germline DNA variants are some of the elements subject to selection during tumor evolution. Integrated examination of inherited variation and somatic alterations holds the potential to reveal specific nucleotide alleles that a tumor "prefers" to have amplified. Next-generation sequencing of tumor and matched normal tissues provides a high-resolution platform to identify and analyze such somatic amplicons. Within an amplicon, examination of informative (e.g., heterozygous) sites deviating from a 1:1 ratio may suggest selection of that allele. A naive approach examines the reads for each heterozygous site in isolation; however, this ignores available valuable linkage information across sites. We, therefore, present a novel hidden Markov model-based method-Haplotype Amplification in Tumor Sequences (HATS)-that analyzes tumor and normal sequence data, along with training data for phasing purposes, to infer amplified alleles and haplotypes in regions of copy number gain. Our method is designed to handle rare variants and biases in read data. We assess the performance of HATS using simulated amplified regions generated from varying copy number and coverage levels, followed by amplicons in real data. We demonstrate that HATS infers the amplified alleles more accurately than does the naive approach, especially at low to intermediate coverage levels and in cases (including high coverage) possessing stromal contamination or allelic bias.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Typesetting, shading and labeling of nucleotide and peptide alignments using standard word processing or graphics software is time consuming. Available automatic sequence shading programs usually do not allow manual application of additional shadings or labels. Hence, a flexible alignment shading package was designed for both calculated and manual shading, using the macro language of the scientific typesetting software LATEX2 epsilon. RESULTS: TEXshade is the first TEX-based alignment shading software featuring, in addition to standard identity and similarity shading, special modes for the display of functional aspects such as charge, hydropathy or solvent accessibility. A plenitude of commands for manual shading, graphical labels, re-arrangements of the sequence order, numbering, legends etc. is implemented. Further, TEXshade allows the inclusion and display of secondary structure predictions in the DSSP-, STRIDE- and PHD-format.

Descriptive models are often said to be phenomenologically motivated whereas explanatory models are said to be mechanistically motivated. In molecular evolutionary modeling the two approaches can typically be classified as dealing with either the inference of phylogenies - the phenomenological approach, lacking particular interest in evolutionary mechanisms per se, or focused on explaining the evolutionary process itself - the mechanistic approach. Here we emphasize that both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches are inherently present in any model. Focusing on the field of codon substitution modeling we point out that this area, traditionally viewed as being mechanistically motivated, has itself been imbued with phenomenological underpinnings. Using practical examples we stress that clarifying phenomenological and mechanistic motivations can help guide model developments, and suggest future work directions.},

abstract = {Computational efforts to identify functional elements within genomes leverage comparative sequence information by looking for regions that exhibit evidence of selective constraint. One way of detecting constrained elements is to follow a bottom-up approach by computing constraint scores for individual positions of a multiple alignment and then defining constrained elements as segments of contiguous, highly scoring nucleotide positions. Here we present GERP++, a new tool that uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation for position-specific scoring and, in contrast to previous bottom-up methods, a novel dynamic programming approach to subsequently define constrained elements. GERP++ evaluates a richer set of candidate element breakpoints and ranks them based on statistical significance, eliminating the need for biased heuristic extension techniques. Using GERP++ we identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7{\%} of the human genome. We predict a higher fraction than earlier estimates largely due to the annotation of longer constrained elements, which improves one to one correspondence between predicted elements with known functional sequences. GERP++ is an efficient and effective tool to provide both nucleotide- and element-level constraint scores within deep multiple sequence alignments.},

Recent work has argued that the study of proteins can be simplified by the use of correlated mutations in the evolutionary record to locate a small subset of thermodynamically coupled residues that participate in functionally important, evolutionarily conserved energetic pathways. To test this hypothesis, we examined the predictions of correlated mutation algorithms for a number of proteins for which coupling between residues has been determined by analysis of double mutant cycles. We find that correlated mutation algorithms can find residue pairs that are physically close and that physically close residue pairs tend to be thermodynamically coupled. We find little evidence, however, for the hypothesis that thermodynamic coupling is limited to the subset of evolutionarily constrained residue positions.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that common diseases can be due to functional variants with a wide spectrum of allele frequencies, ranging from rare to common. An effective way to identify rare variants is through direct sequencing. The development of cost-effective sequencing technologies enables association studies to use sequence data from candidate genes and, in the future, from the entire genome. Although methods used for analysis of common variants are applicable to sequence data, their performance might not be optimal. In this study, it is shown that the collapsing method, which involves collapsing genotypes across variants and applying a univariate test, is powerful for analyzing rare variants, whereas multivariate analysis is robust against inclusion of noncausal variants. Both methods are superior to analyzing each variant individually with univariate tests. In order to unify the advantages of both collapsing and multiple-marker tests, we developed the Combined Multivariate and Collapsing (CMC) method and demonstrated that the CMC method is both powerful and robust. The CMC method can be applied to either candidate-gene or whole-genome sequence data.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a key role in gene regulation. Previous studies have investigated its genetic basis by mapping genetic variants that are associated with DNA methylation at specific sites, but these have been limited to microarrays that cover {\textless}2{\%} of the genome and cannot account for allele-specific methylation (ASM). Other studies have performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on a few individuals, but these lack statistical power to identify variants associated with DNA methylation. We present a novel approach in which bisulfite-treated DNA from many individuals is sequenced together in a single pool, resulting in a truly genome-wide map of DNA methylation. Compared to methods that do not account for ASM, our approach increases statistical power to detect associations while sharply reducing cost, effort, and experimental variability. As a proof of concept, we generated deep sequencing data from a pool of 60 human cell lines; we evaluated almost twice as many CpGs as the largest microarray studies and identified more than 2000 genetic variants associated with DNA methylation. We found that these variants are highly enriched for associations with chromatin accessibility and CTCF binding but are less likely to be associated with traits indirectly linked to DNA, such as gene expression and disease phenotypes. In summary, our approach allows genome-wide mapping of genetic variants associated with DNA methylation in any tissue of any species, without the need for individual-level genotype or methylation data.},

@article{Szollosi:2011fk,
abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel belonging to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. ABC proteins share a common molecular mechanism that couples ATP binding and hydrolysis at two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) to diverse functions. This involves formation of NBD dimers, with ATP bound at two composite interfacial sites. In CFTR, intramolecular NBD dimerization is coupled to channel opening. Channel closing is triggered by hydrolysis of the ATP molecule bound at composite site 2. Site 1, which is non-canonical, binds nucleotide tightly but is not hydrolytic. Recently, based on kinetic arguments, it was suggested that this site remains closed for several gating cycles. To investigate movements at site 1 by an independent technique, we studied changes in thermodynamic coupling between pairs of residues on opposite sides of this site. The chosen targets are likely to interact based on both phylogenetic analysis and closeness on structural models. First, we mutated T460 in NBD1 and L1353 in NBD2 (the corresponding site-2 residues become energetically coupled as channels open). Mutation T460S accelerated closure in hydrolytic conditions and in the nonhydrolytic K1250R background; mutation L1353M did not affect these rates. Analysis of the double mutant showed additive effects of mutations, suggesting that energetic coupling between the two residues remains unchanged during the gating cycle. We next investigated pairs 460-1348 and 460-1375. Although both mutations H1348A and H1375A produced dramatic changes in hydrolytic and nonhydrolytic channel closing rates, in the corresponding double mutants these changes proved mostly additive with those caused by mutation T460S, suggesting little change in energetic coupling between either positions 460-1348 or positions 460-1375 during gating. These results provide independent support for a gating model in which ATP-bound composite site 1 remains closed throughout the gating cycle.},

abstract = {ABC transporters constitute one of the most abundant membrane transporter families. The most common feature shared in the family is the highly conserved nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) that drive the transport process through binding and hydrolysis of ATP. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the effect of ATP hydrolysis in the NBDs. Starting with the ATP-bound, closed dimer of MalK, four simulation systems with all possible combinations of ATP or ADP-P(i) bound to the two nucleotide binding sites are constructed and simulated with equilibrium molecular dynamics for approximately 70 ns each. The results suggest that the closed form of the NBD dimer can only be maintained with two bound ATP molecules; in other words, hydrolysis of one ATP can lead to the opening of the dimer interface of the NBD dimer. Furthermore, we observed that the opening is an immediate effect of hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and P(i) rather than the dissociation of hydrolysis products. In addition, the opening is mechanistically triggered by the dissociation of the LSGGQ motif from the bound nucleotide. A metastable ADP-P(i) bound conformational state is consistently observed before the dimer opening in all the simulation systems.},

Much of our present knowledge derives from high-throughput techniques such as the yeast two-hybrid assay and affinity purification, as well as from manual curation of experiments on individual systems. A variety of computational approaches based, for example, on sequence homology, gene co-expression and phylogenetic profiles, have also been developed for the genome-wide inference of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Yet comparative studies suggest that the development of accurate and complete repertoires of PPIs is still in its early stages. Here we show that three-dimensional structural information can be used to predict PPIs with an accuracy and coverage that are superior to predictions based on non-structural evidence. Moreover, an algorithm, termed PrePPI, which combines structural information with other functional clues, is comparable in accuracy to high-throughput experiments, yielding over 30,000 high-confidence interactions for yeast and over 300,000 for human. Experimental tests of a number of predictions demonstrate the ability of the PrePPI algorithm to identify unexpected PPIs of considerable biological interest. The surprising effectiveness of three-dimensional structural information can be attributed to the use of homology models combined with the exploitation of both close and remote geometric relationships between proteins.},

In this review, we provide an overview of experimentally validated, de novo designed proteins and compare four available programs, RosettaDesign, EGAD, Liang-Grishin, and RosettaDesign-SR, by assessing designed sequences computationally. Computational assessment includes the recovery of native sequences, the calculation of sizes of hydrophobic patches and total solvent-accessible surface area, and the prediction of structural properties such as intrinsic disorder, secondary structures, and three-dimensional structures. This computational assessment, together with a recent community-wide experiment in assessing scoring functions for interface design, suggests that the next-generation protein-design scoring function will come from the right balance of complementary interaction terms.

Currently available short read aligners and DNA variant callers suffer from these problems. We developed the Coval software to improve the quality of short read alignments. Coval is designed to minimize the incidence of spurious alignment of short reads, by filtering mismatched reads that remained in alignments after local realignment and error correction of mismatched reads. The error correction is executed based on the base quality and allele frequency at the non-reference positions for an individual or pooled sample. We demonstrated the utility of Coval by applying it to simulated genomes and experimentally obtained short-read data of rice, nematode, and mouse. Moreover, we found an unexpectedly large number of incorrectly mapped reads in ‘targeted' alignments, where the whole genome sequencing reads had been aligned to a local genomic segment, and showed that Coval effectively eliminated such spurious alignments. We conclude that Coval significantly improves the quality of short-read sequence alignments, thereby increasing the calling accuracy of currently available tools for SNP and indel identification.

Using this resource, ∼20{\%} of schizophrenia loci have variants that could contribute to altered gene expression and liability. In five loci, only a single gene was involved: FURIN, TSNARE1, CNTN4, CLCN3 or SNAP91. Altering expression of FURIN, TSNARE1 or CNTN4 changed neurodevelopment in zebrafish; knockdown of FURIN in human neural progenitor cells yielded abnormal migration. Of 693 genes showing significant case-versus-control differential expression, their fold changes were ≤ 1.33, and an independent cohort yielded similar results.

When this genetic variation affects protein sequences, the rate of amino acid substitution reflects both Darwinian selection for functionally advantageous mutations and selectively neutral evolution operating within the constraints of structure and function. During neutral evolution, whereby mutations accumulate by random drift, amino acid substitutions are constrained by factors such as the formation of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and the accessibility to water or lipids surrounding the protein. These constraints arise from the need to conserve a specific architecture and to retain interactions that mediate functions in protein families and superfamilies.},

Single channel currents through acetylcholine receptor channels (ACh channels) were recorded at chronically denervated frog muscle extrajunctional membranes in the absence and presence of the lidocaine derivatives QX-222 and QX-314. 2. The current wave forms due to the opening and closing of single ACh channels (activated by suberyldicholine) normally are square pulses. These single pulses appear to be chopped into bursts of much shorter pulses, when the drug QX-222 is present in addition to the agonist. 3. The mean duration of the bursts is comparable to or longer than the normal channel open time, and increases with increasing drug concentration. 4. The duration of the short pulses within a burst decreases with increasing drug concentration. 5. It is concluded that drug molecules reversibly block open end-plate channels and that the flickering within a burst represents this fast, repeatedly occurring reaction. 6. The voltage dependence of the reaction rates involved, suggested that the site of the blocking reaction is in the centre of the membrane, probably inside the ionic channel.},

abstract = {It has been known since the work of Katz and collaborators in the early 1950s that an increase in intracellular Ca(++) concentration ([Ca(++)]) is the immediate trigger for neurotransmitter release. Later work has shown that, next to Ca(++), many other signaling pathways, particularly via cyclic AMP, modulate the release of both neurotransmitters and hormones. However, regulated secretion is a multistep process and the signaling mechanisms involved act at many stages. Biochemical and traditional electrophysiological techniques very often cannot distinguish whether a change in secretion is caused by regulation of ion channels, vesicle trafficking, or the exocytic process itself. My laboratory has made an effort to dissect the stimulus secretion pathway by developing assays in chromaffin cells (for catecholamine release) and at a glutamatergic central nervous synapse (the calyx of Held, a component of the auditory pathway), which permit the study of secretion in single cells under voltage clamp conditions. This enables us to clearly distinguish between consequences of changes in electrical signaling, from those regarding the process of vesicle recruitment or the process of exocytosis.},

abstract = {Frog skin glands were stripped of connective tissue and investigated using the nystatin-permeabilized whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. The membrane potential in unstimulated acinar cells was -69.5+/-0.7 mV, and the conductance was dominated by K+, based on ion substitution experiments. The cells were electrically coupled through heptanol- and halothane-sensitive gap junctions. During application of gap junction blockers, the whole-cell current/voltage relationship displayed strong outward rectification. Outward currents were blocked by barium. Stimulation by agonists known to cause increases in either cytosolic cAMP ([cAMP]c) (isoproterenol, prostaglandin E2, both at 2 microM) or free cellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) (noradrenaline, 10 microM, added with propranolol, 5 microM; carbachol, 100 microM) in the frog skin glands caused reversible depolarization: by 34+/-3 mV, 36+/-3 mV, 25+/-3 mV (plateau-phase), and 20+/-3 mV, respectively. Ion substitution experiments showed that stimulation through either pathway (cAMP or Ca2+) resulted in the activation of a Cl- conductance. Application of noradrenaline or adrenaline resulted in a faster depolarization (rates 22 mV/s, 26 mV/s) than stimulation by isoproterenol or prostaglandin E2 (5.6-5.7 mV/s). Cells that were depolarized by exposure to isoproterenol or prostaglandin E2 partially repolarized when stimulated by noradrenaline. The repolarization was blocked by Ba2+ (5 mM) or prazosine (1 microM), consistent with the activation of Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels via alpha1-adrenergic receptors. We conclude that in the frog skin gland both Ca(2+)-dependent and cAMP-dependent Cl- channels are present in the apical membrane. Increases in free [Ca2+]c in the cAMP-stimulated gland results in the activation of K+ channels, thereby increasing the driving force for Cl- exit.},

abstract = {Information theory was used to identify nonconserved coevolving positions in multiple sequence alignments from a variety of protein families. Coevolving positions in these alignments fall into two general categories. One set is composed of positions that coevolve with only one or two other positions. These positions often display direct amino acid side-chain interactions with their coevolving partner. The other set comprises positions that coevolve with many others and are frequently located in regions critical for protein function, such as active sites and surfaces involved in intermolecular interactions and recognition. We find that coevolving positions are more likely to change protein function when mutated than are positions showing little coevolution. These results imply that information theory may be applied generally to find coevolving, nonconserved positions that are part of functional sites in uncharacterized protein families. We propose that these coevolving positions compose an important subset of the positions in an alignment, and may be as important to the structure and function of the protein family as are highly conserved positions.},

The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method.

Applied to the S1A serine proteases, the analysis indicates a decomposition of the protein into three quasi-independent groups of correlated amino acids that we term "protein sectors." Each sector is physically connected in the tertiary structure, has a distinct functional role, and constitutes an independent mode of sequence divergence in the protein family. Functionally relevant sectors are evident in other protein families as well, suggesting that they may be general features of proteins.

Exploiting these resources, several computational methods have been developed for integration and analysis of phenotype data to identify the genetic etiology of diseases or suggest plausible interventions. A similar resource would be highly useful not only for rare and Mendelian diseases, but also for common, complex and infectious diseases. We apply a semantic text-mining approach to identify the phenotypes (signs and symptoms) associated with over 6,000 diseases. We evaluate our text-mined phenotypes by demonstrating that they can correctly identify known disease-associated genes in mice and humans with high accuracy. Using a phenotypic similarity measure, we generate a human disease network in which diseases that have similar signs and symptoms cluster together, and we use this network to identify closely related diseases based on common etiological, anatomical as well as physiological underpinnings.},

This paper concerns the use of the bootstrap in the tree problem. We show that Felsenstein's method is not biased, but that it can be corrected to better agree with standard ideas of confidence levels and hypothesis testing. These corrections can be made by using the more elaborate bootstrap method presented here, at the expense of considerably more computation.},

However, because of their intrinsic reliance on summary statistics, distance-matrix methods are assumed to be less accurate than likelihood-based approaches. In this paper, pairwise sequence comparisons are shown to be more powerful than previously hypothesized. A statistical analysis of certain distance-based techniques indicates that their data requirement for large evolutionary trees essentially matches the conjectured performance of maximum likelihood methods--challenging the idea that summary statistics lead to suboptimal analyses. On the basis of a connection between ancestral state reconstruction and distance averaging, the critical role played by the covariances of the distance matrix is identified.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a plasma membrane Cl- channel regulated by cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation and by intracellular ATP. Mutations in CFTR cause cystic fibrosis partly through loss of cAMP-regulated Cl- permeability from the plasma membrane of affected epithelia. The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis is deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (CFTR delta F508) (ref. 10). Studies on the biosynthesis and localization of CFTR delta F508 indicate that the mutant protein is not processed correctly and, as a result, is not delivered to the plasma membrane. These conclusions are consistent with earlier functional studies which failed to detect cAMP-stimulated Cl- channels in cells expressing CFTR delta F508 (refs 16, 17). Chloride channel activity was detected, however, when CFTR delta F508 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, Vero cells and Sf9 insect cells. Because oocytes and Sf9 cells are typically maintained at lower temperatures than mammalian cells, and because processing of nascent proteins can be sensitive to temperature, we tested the effect of temperature on the processing of CFTR delta F508. Here we show that the processing of CFTR delta F508 reverts towards that of wild-type as the incubation temperature is reduced. When the processing defect is corrected, cAMP-regulated Cl- channels appear in the plasma membrane. These results reconcile previous contradictory observations and suggest that the mutant most commonly associated with cystic fibrosis is temperature-sensitive.},

abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in protein-protein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of {\textgreater}2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase (SK) and response regulator (RR) proteins and for homointeractions between RR proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of protein-protein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. To better understand how GBM evolves, we analyzed longitudinal genomic and transcriptomic data from 114 patients. The analysis shows a highly branched evolutionary pattern in which 63{\%} of patients experience expression-based subtype changes. The branching pattern, together with estimates of evolutionary rate, suggests that relapse-associated clones typically existed years before diagnosis. Fifteen percent of tumors present hypermutation at relapse in highly expressed genes, with a clear mutational signature. We find that 11{\%} of recurrence tumors harbor mutations in LTBP4, which encodes a protein binding to TGF-$\beta$. Silencing LTBP4 in GBM cells leads to suppression of TGF-$\beta$ activity and decreased cell proliferation. In recurrent GBM with wild-type IDH1, high LTBP4 expression is associated with worse prognosis, highlighting the TGF-$\beta$ pathway as a potential therapeutic target in GBM.},

abstract = {By comparing mammalian genomes, we and others have identified actively transcribed Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon-derived genes with highly conserved DNA sequences and insertion sites. To elucidate the functions of evolutionarily conserved retrotransposon-derived genes in mammalian development, we produced mice that lack one of these genes, Peg10 (paternally expressed 10), which is a paternally expressed imprinted gene on mouse proximal chromosome 6. The Peg10 knockout mice showed early embryonic lethality owing to defects in the placenta. This indicates that Peg10 is critical for mouse parthenogenetic development and provides the first direct evidence of an essential role of an evolutionarily conserved retrotransposon-derived gene in mammalian development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An elastic network model is proposed for the interactions between closely ({\textless} or = 7.0 A) located alpha-carbon pairs in folded proteins. A single-parameter harmonic potential is adopted for the fluctuations of residues about their mean positions in the crystal structure. The model is based on writing the Kirchhoff adjacency matrix for a protein defining the proximity of residues in space. The elements of the inverse of the Kirchhoff matrix give directly the auto-correlations or cross-correlations of atomic fluctuations. RESULTS: The temperature factors of the C alpha atoms of 12 X-ray structures, ranging from a 41 residue subunit to a 633 residue dimer, are accurately predicted. Cross-correlations are also efficiently characterized, in close agreement with results obtained with a normal mode analysis coupled with energy minimization. CONCLUSIONS: The simple model and method proposed here provide a satisfactory description of the correlations between atomic fluctuations. Furthermore, this is achieved within computation times at least one order of magnitude shorter than commonly used molecular approaches.},

abstract = {Major efforts to sequence cancer genomes are now occurring throughout the world. Though the emerging data from these studies are illuminating, their reconciliation with epidemiologic and clinical observations poses a major challenge. In the current study, we provide a mathematical model that begins to address this challenge. We model tumors as a discrete time branching process that starts with a single driver mutation and proceeds as each new driver mutation leads to a slightly increased rate of clonal expansion. Using the model, we observe tremendous variation in the rate of tumor development-providing an understanding of the heterogeneity in tumor sizes and development times that have been observed by epidemiologists and clinicians. Furthermore, the model provides a simple formula for the number of driver mutations as a function of the total number of mutations in the tumor. Finally, when applied to recent experimental data, the model allows us to calculate the actual selective advantage provided by typical somatic mutations in human tumors in situ. This selective advantage is surprisingly small--0.004 ± 0.0004--and has major implications for experimental cancer research.},

Obtaining accurate alignments, however, is a difficult computational problem because of not only the high computational cost but also the lack of proper objective functions for measuring alignment quality. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic consistency, a novel scoring function for multiple sequence comparisons. We present ProbCons, a practical tool for progressive protein multiple sequence alignment based on probabilistic consistency, and evaluate its performance on several standard alignment benchmark data sets. On the BAliBASE, SABmark, and PREFAB benchmark alignment databases, ProbCons achieves statistically significant improvement over other leading methods while maintaining practical speed.

This is clinically relevant, as tumour cells may become resistant to agents used in chemotherapy. To understand the molecular basis of this process, we have determined the 3.0 A crystal structure of a bacterial ABC transporter (Sav1866) from Staphylococcus aureus. The homodimeric protein consists of 12 transmembrane helices in an arrangement that is consistent with cross-linking studies and electron microscopic imaging of the human multidrug resistance protein MDR1, but critically different from that reported for the bacterial lipid flippase MsbA. The observed, outward-facing conformation reflects the ATP-bound state, with the two nucleotide-binding domains in close contact and the two transmembrane domains forming a central cavity--presumably the drug translocation pathway--that is shielded from the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer and from the cytoplasm, but exposed to the outer leaflet and the extracellular space.},

abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, microRNA regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

abstract = {When attached outside the voltage-sensing S4 segment of the Shaker potassium channel, the fluorescent probe tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM) undergoes voltage-dependent fluorescence changes (DeltaF) due to differential interaction with a pH-titratable external protein-lined vestibule (Cha, A., and F. Bezanilla. 1998. J. Gen. Physiol. 112:391-408.). We attached TMRM at the same sites [corresponding to M356C and A359C in the wild-type (wt) channel] in a deletion mutant of Shaker where all but the five amino acids closest to S4 had been removed from the S3-S4 linker. In the deletion mutant, the maximal DeltaF/F seen was diminished 10-fold, and the DeltaF at M356C became pH independent, suggesting that the protein-lined vestibule is made up in large part by the S3-S4 linker. The residual DeltaF showed that the probe still interacted with two putative quenching groups near the S4 segment. One group was detected by M356C-TMRM (located outside of S3 in the deletion mutant) and reported on deactivation gating charge movement when applying hyperpolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of 0 mV. During activating voltage steps from a holding potential of -90 mV, the fluorescence lagged considerably behind the movement of gating charge over a range of potentials. Another putative quenching group was seen by probes attached closer to the S4 and caused a DeltaF at extreme hyperpolarizations (more negative than -90 mV) only. A signal from the interaction with this group in the wt S3-S4 linker channel (at L361C) correlated with gating charge moving in the hyperpolarized part of the Q-V curve. Probe attached at A359C in the deletion mutant and at L361C in wt channel showed a biphasic DeltaF as the probe oscillated between the two groups, revealing that there is a transient state of the voltage sensor in between, where the probe has maximal fluorescence. We conclude that the voltage sensor undergoes two distinct conformational changes as seen from probes attached outside the S4 segment.},

We present a new statistical method, applicable to genotype data at linked loci from a population sample, that improves substantially on current algorithms; often, error rates are reduced by {\textgreater} 50{\%}, relative to its nearest competitor. Furthermore, our algorithm performs well in absolute terms, suggesting that reconstructing haplotypes experimentally or by genotyping additional family members may be an inefficient use of resources.},

Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation.

abstract = {At the early stage of infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 predominantly uses the CCR5 coreceptor for host cell entry. The subsequent emergence of HIV variants that use the CXCR4 coreceptor in roughly half of all infections is associated with an accelerated decline of CD4+ T-cells and rate of progression to AIDS. The presence of a 'fitness valley' separating CCR5- and CXCR4-using genotypes is postulated to be a biological determinant of whether the HIV coreceptor switch occurs. Using phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the evolutionary dynamics of HIV within hosts enables us to discriminate between competing models of this process. We have developed a phylogenetic pipeline for the molecular clock analysis, ancestral reconstruction, and visualization of deep sequence data. These data were generated by next-generation sequencing of HIV RNA extracted from longitudinal serum samples (median 7 time points) from 8 untreated subjects with chronic HIV infections (Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV-1 infection and AIDS). We used the known dates of sampling to directly estimate rates of evolution and to map ancestral mutations to a reconstructed timeline in units of days. HIV coreceptor usage was predicted from reconstructed ancestral sequences using the geno2pheno algorithm. We determined that the first mutations contributing to CXCR4 use emerged about 16 (per subject range 4 to 30) months before the earliest predicted CXCR4-using ancestor, which preceded the first positive cell-based assay of CXCR4 usage by 10 (range 5 to 25) months. CXCR4 usage arose in multiple lineages within 5 of 8 subjects, and ancestral lineages following alternate mutational pathways before going extinct were common. We observed highly patient-specific distributions and time-scales of mutation accumulation, implying that the role of a fitness valley is contingent on the genotype of the transmitted variant.},

abstract = {Mapping expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) represents a powerful and widely adopted approach to identifying putative regulatory variants and linking them to specific genes. Up to now eQTL studies have been conducted in a relatively narrow range of tissues or cell types. However, understanding the biology of organismal phenotypes will involve understanding regulation in multiple tissues, and ongoing studies are collecting eQTL data in dozens of cell types. Here we present a statistical framework for powerfully detecting eQTLs in multiple tissues or cell types (or, more generally, multiple subgroups). The framework explicitly models the potential for each eQTL to be active in some tissues and inactive in others. By modeling the sharing of active eQTLs among tissues, this framework increases power to detect eQTLs that are present in more than one tissue compared with "tissue-by-tissue" analyses that examine each tissue separately. Conversely, by modeling the inactivity of eQTLs in some tissues, the framework allows the proportion of eQTLs shared across different tissues to be formally estimated as parameters of a model, addressing the difficulties of accounting for incomplete power when comparing overlaps of eQTLs identified by tissue-by-tissue analyses. Applying our framework to re-analyze data from transformed B cells, T cells, and fibroblasts, we find that it substantially increases power compared with tissue-by-tissue analysis, identifying 63{\%} more genes with eQTLs (at FDR = 0.05). Further, the results suggest that, in contrast to previous analyses of the same data, the majority of eQTLs detectable in these data are shared among all three tissues.},

abstract = {Widely used models of protein evolution ignore protein structure. Therefore, these models do not predict spatial clustering of amino acid replacements with respect to tertiary structure. One formal and biologically implausible possibility is that there is no tendency for amino acid replacements to be spatially clustered during evolution. An alternative to this is that amino acid replacements are spatially clustered and this spatial clustering can be fully explained by a tendency for similar rates of amino acid replacement at sites that are nearby in protein tertiary structure. A third possibility is that the amount of clustering exceeds that which can be explained solely on the basis of independently evolving protein sites with spatially clustered replacement rates. We introduce two simple and not very parametric hypothesis tests that help distinguish these three possibilities. We then apply these tests to 273 homologous protein families. The null hypothesis of no spatial clustering is rejected for 102 of 273 families. The explanation of spatially clustered rates but independent change among sites is rejected for 43 families. These findings need to be reconciled with the common practice of basing evolutionary inferences on models that assume independent change among sites.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The study of cancer genomes now routinely involves using next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) to profile tumours for single nucleotide variant (SNV) somatic mutations. However, surprisingly few published bioinformatics methods exist for the specific purpose of identifying somatic mutations from NGS data and existing tools are often inaccurate, yielding intolerably high false prediction rates. As such, the computational problem of accurately inferring somatic mutations from paired tumour/normal NGS data remains an unsolved challenge.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present the comparison of four standard supervised machine learning algorithms for the purpose of somatic SNV prediction in tumour/normal NGS experiments. To evaluate these approaches (random forest, Bayesian additive regression tree, support vector machine and logistic regression), we constructed 106 features representing 3369 candidate somatic SNVs from 48 breast cancer genomes, originally predicted with naive methods and subsequently revalidated to establish ground truth labels. We trained the classifiers on this data (consisting of 1015 true somatic mutations and 2354 non-somatic mutation positions) and conducted a rigorous evaluation of these methods using a cross-validation framework and hold-out test NGS data from both exome capture and whole genome shotgun platforms. All learning algorithms employing predictive discriminative approaches with feature selection improved the predictive accuracy over standard approaches by statistically significant margins. In addition, using unsupervised clustering of the ground truth 'false positive' predictions, we noted several distinct classes and present evidence suggesting non-overlapping sources of technical artefacts illuminating important directions for future study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: Software called MutationSeq and datasets are available from http://compbio.bccrc.ca.},

abstract = {The extent to which evolution is reversible has long fascinated biologists. Most previous work on the reversibility of morphological and life-history evolution has been indecisive, because of uncertainty and bias in the methods used to infer ancestral states for such characters. Further, despite theoretical work on the factors that could contribute to irreversibility, there is little empirical evidence on its causes, because sufficient understanding of the mechanistic basis for the evolution of new or ancestral phenotypes is seldom available. By studying the reversibility of evolutionary changes in protein structure and function, these limitations can be overcome. Here we show, using the evolution of hormone specificity in the vertebrate glucocorticoid receptor as a case-study, that the evolutionary path by which this protein acquired its new function soon became inaccessible to reverse exploration. Using ancestral gene reconstruction, protein engineering and X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate that five subsequent 'restrictive' mutations, which optimized the new specificity of the glucocorticoid receptor, also destabilized elements of the protein structure that were required to support the ancestral conformation. Unless these ratchet-like epistatic substitutions are restored to their ancestral states, reversing the key function-switching mutations yields a non-functional protein. Reversing the restrictive substitutions first, however, does nothing to enhance the ancestral function. Our findings indicate that even if selection for the ancestral function were imposed, direct reversal would be extremely unlikely, suggesting an important role for historical contingency in protein evolution.},

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows rapid analysis of multiple genes for clinically actionable somatic variants. The WUCaMP assay uses targeted capture for NGS analysis of 25 cancer-associated genes to detect mutations at actionable loci. We present clinical validation of the assay and a detailed framework for design and validation of similar clinical assays. Deep sequencing of 78 tumor specimens (≥1000× average unique coverage across the capture region) achieved high sensitivity for detecting somatic variants at low allele fraction (AF). Validation revealed sensitivities and specificities of 100{\%} for detection of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within coding regions, compared with SNP array sequence data (95{\%} CI = 83.4-100.0 for sensitivity and 94.2-100.0 for specificity) or whole-genome sequencing (95{\%} CI = 89.1-100.0 for sensitivity and 99.9-100.0 for specificity) of HapMap samples. Sensitivity for detecting variants at an observed 10{\%} AF was 100{\%} (95{\%} CI = 93.2-100.0) in HapMap mixes. Analysis of 15 masked specimens harboring clinically reported variants yielded concordant calls for 13/13 variants at AF of ≥15{\%}.

The complexity and unique features of the brain suggest that somatic mosaicism can play an important role in behavior and cognition. Here we review recent manuscripts showing instances of somatic mosaicism in the brain and estimating its extent and possible biological consequences. The consequences of somatic mosaicism span vast dimensions -from a single-locus variant, to genes and gene networks, to cells, to the interactions of the mosaic cells via neural networks affecting behavior and cognition. We highlight how systems biology approaches are particularly well suited for the complex emerging field of brain somatic mosaicism.},

We identified 414,510 SNPs that might affect miRNA-mRNA binding. Annotations were added to these SNPs to predict whether a SNP within the target site would decrease/break or enhance/create an miRNA-mRNA binding site. By applying MirSNP database to three brain eQTL data sets, we identified four unreported SNPs (rs3087822, rs13042, rs1058381, and rs1058398), which might affect miRNA binding and thus affect the expression of their host genes in the brain. We also applied the MirSNP database to our GWAS for schizophrenia: seven predicted miRNA-related SNPs (p {\textless} 0.0001) were found in the schizophrenia GWAS. Our findings identified the possible functions of these SNP loci, and provide the basis for subsequent functional research.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: MirSNP could identify the putative miRNA-related SNPs from GWAS and eQTLs researches and provide the direction for subsequent functional researches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large number of bioinformatics applications in the fields of bio-sequence analysis, molecular evolution and population genetics typically share input/output methods, data storage requirements and data analysis algorithms. Such common features may be conveniently bundled into re-usable libraries, which enable the rapid development of new methods and robust applications. RESULTS: We present Bio++, a set of Object Oriented libraries written in C++. Available components include classes for data storage and handling (nucleotide/amino-acid/codon sequences, trees, distance matrices, population genetics datasets), various input/output formats, basic sequence manipulation (concatenation, transcription, translation, etc.), phylogenetic analysis (maximum parsimony, markov models, distance methods, likelihood computation and maximization), population genetics/genomics (diversity statistics, neutrality tests, various multi-locus analyses) and various algorithms for numerical calculus. CONCLUSION: Implementation of methods aims at being both efficient and user-friendly. A special concern was given to the library design to enable easy extension and new methods development. We defined a general hierarchy of classes that allow the developer to implement its own algorithms while remaining compatible with the rest of the libraries. Bio++ source code is distributed free of charge under the CeCILL general public licence from its website http://kimura.univ-montp2.fr/BioPP.},

abstract = {Synaptotagmin-1, the canonical isoform of the synaptotagmin family, is a Ca(2+) sensor for fast synchronous neurotransmitter release in forebrain neurons and chromaffin cells. Even though deletion of synaptotagmin-1 abolishes fast exocytosis in chromaffin cells, it reduces overall secretion by only 20{\%} because of the persistence of slow exocytosis. Therefore, another Ca(2+) sensor dominates release in these cells. Synaptotagmin-7 has a higher Ca(2+) affinity and slower binding kinetics than synaptotagmin-1, matching the proposed properties for the second, slower Ca(2+) sensor. Here, we examined Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis in chromaffin cells from KO mice lacking synaptotagmin-7, and from knockin mice containing normal levels of a mutant synaptotagmin-7 whose C(2)B domain does not bind Ca(2+). In both types of mutant chromaffin cells, Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis was decreased dramatically. Moreover, in chromaffin cells lacking both synaptotagmin-1 and -7, only a very slow release component, accounting for approximately 30{\%} of WT exocytosis, persisted. These data establish synaptotagmin-7 as a major Ca(2+) sensor for exocytosis in chromaffin cells, which, together with synaptotagmin-1, mediates almost all of the Ca(2+) triggering of exocytosis in these cells, a surprising result, considering the lack of a role of synaptotagmin-7 in synaptic vesicle exocytosis.},

abstract = {In the past, 2 kinds of Markov models have been considered to describe protein sequence evolution. Codon-level models have been mechanistic with a small number of parameters designed to take into account features, such as transition-transversion bias, codon frequency bias, and synonymous-nonsynonymous amino acid substitution bias. Amino acid models have been empirical, attempting to summarize the replacement patterns observed in large quantities of data and not explicitly considering the distinct factors that shape protein evolution. We have estimated the first empirical codon model (ECM). Previous codon models assume that protein evolution proceeds only by successive single nucleotide substitutions, but our results indicate that model accuracy is significantly improved by incorporating instantaneous doublet and triplet changes. We also find that the affiliations between codons, the amino acid each encodes and the physicochemical properties of the amino acids are main factors driving the process of codon evolution. Neither multiple nucleotide changes nor the strong influence of the genetic code nor amino acids' physicochemical properties form a part of standard mechanistic models and their views of how codon evolution proceeds. We have implemented the ECM for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis, and an assessment of its ability to describe protein evolution shows that it consistently outperforms comparable mechanistic codon models. We point out the biological interpretation of our ECM and possible consequences for studies of selection.},

A major challenge in computational biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions and key biological features of cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes based on multiple expression measurements. This framework builds on the use of Bayesian networks for representing statistical dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint multivariate probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes and because they provide a clear methodology for learning from (noisy) observations. We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions between genes. We then describe a method for recovering gene interactions from microarray data using tools for learning Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate this method on the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle measurements of Spellman et al. (1998).},

abstract = {The identification of human cancer-related microRNAs (miRNAs) is important for cancer biology research. Although several identification methods have achieved remarkable success, they have overlooked the functional information associated with miRNAs. We present a computational framework that can be used to prioritize human cancer miRNAs by measuring the association between cancer and miRNAs based on the functional consistency score (FCS) of the miRNA target genes and the cancer-related genes. This approach proved successful in identifying the validated cancer miRNAs for 11 common human cancers with area under ROC curve (AUC) ranging from 71.15{\%} to 96.36{\%}. The FCS method had a significant advantage over miRNA differential expression analysis when identifying cancer-related miRNAs with a fine regulatory mechanism, such as miR-27a in colorectal cancer. Furthermore, a case study examining thyroid cancer showed that the FCS method can uncover novel cancer-related miRNAs such as miR-27a/b, which were showed significantly upregulated in thyroid cancer samples by qRT-PCR analysis. Our method can be used on a web-based server, CMP (cancer miRNA prioritization) and is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/CMP. This time- and cost-effective computational framework can be a valuable complement to experimental studies and can assist with future studies of miRNA involvement in the pathogenesis of cancers.},

For some of these the data remain equivocal, and the frequency in individuals with schizophrenia is uncertain. AIMS To determine the contribution of CNVs at 15 schizophrenia-associated loci (a) using a large new data-set of patients with schizophrenia (n = 6882) and controls (n = 6316), and (b) combining our results with those from previous studies. METHOD We used Illumina microarrays to analyse our data. Analyses were restricted to 520 766 probes common to all arrays used in the different data-sets. RESULTS We found higher rates in participants with schizophrenia than in controls for 13 of the 15 previously implicated CNVs. Six were nominally significantly associated (P{\textless}0.05) in this new data-set: deletions at 1q21.1, NRXN1, 15q11.2 and 22q11.2 and duplications at 16p11.2 and the Angelman/Prader-Willi Syndrome (AS/PWS) region. All eight AS/PWS duplications in patients were of maternal origin. When combined with published data, 11 of the 15 loci showed highly significant evidence for association with schizophrenia (P{\textless}4.1×10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS We strengthen the support for the majority of the previously implicated CNVs in schizophrenia. About 2.5{\%} of patients with schizophrenia and 0.9{\%} of controls carry a large, detectable CNV at one of these loci. Routine CNV screening may be clinically appropriate given the high rate of known deleterious mutations in the disorder and the comorbidity associated with these heritable mutations.},

It would be desirable to have a program that provides these services in an efficient and user-friendly way, and that can be easily installed and run on all major operating systems. Although a large number of tree visualization tools are freely available, some as a part of more comprehensive analysis packages, all have drawbacks in one or more domains. They either lack some of the standard tree visualization techniques or basic graphics and editing features, or they are restricted to small trees containing only tens of thousands of taxa. Moreover, many programs are difficult to install or are not available for all common operating systems. RESULTS: We have developed a new program, Dendroscope, for the interactive visualization and navigation of phylogenetic trees. The program provides all standard tree visualizations and is optimized to run interactively on trees containing hundreds of thousands of taxa. The program provides tree editing and graphics export capabilities. To support the inspection of large trees, Dendroscope offers a magnification tool. The software is written in Java 1.4 and installers are provided for Linux/Unix, MacOS X and Windows XP.

abstract = {The structure and function of a protein is dependent on coordinated interactions between its residues. The selective pressures associated with a mutation at one site should therefore depend on the amino acid identity of interacting sites. Mutual information has previously been applied to multiple sequence alignments as a means of detecting coevolutionary interactions. Here, we introduce a refinement of the mutual information method that: 1) removes a significant, non-coevolutionary bias and 2) accounts for heteroscedasticity. Using a large, non-overlapping database of protein alignments, we demonstrate that predicted coevolving residue-pairs tend to lie in close physical proximity. We introduce coevolution potentials as a novel measure of the propensity for the 20 amino acids to pair amongst predicted coevolutionary interactions. Ionic, hydrogen, and disulfide bond-forming pairs exhibited the highest potentials. Finally, we demonstrate that pairs of catalytic residues have a significantly increased likelihood to be identified as coevolving. These correlations to distinct protein features verify the accuracy of our algorithm and are consistent with a model of coevolution in which selective pressures towards preserving residue interactions act to shape the mutational landscape of a protein by restricting the set of admissible neutral mutations.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was the presentation of the results of iliac venous stent placement in the management of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). Methods: Balloon dilation and stent placement for the relief of iliac vein stenoses was performed in 304 limbs with symptomatic CVI. Sixty-one limbs had concomitant saphenous vein ablation. The median age was 52 years (range, 14 to 83 years). The ratio of postthrombotic to nonthrombotic CVI was 1 to 0.9. The CEAP classification clinical scores were: C2, 24; C3, 158; C4, 60; C5, 13; and C6, 49. Associated reflux was present in 57{\%} of the limbs. The procedure was performed on an outpatient basis. Intravascular ultrasound scanning was routinely performed because transfemoral venography had poor sensitivity for the detection of iliac vein stenosis. Results: The actuarial primary and secondary stent patency rates at 24 months were 71{\%} and 90{\%}, respectively. The median degree of swelling (graded 0 to 3, for none, pitting, ankle edema, to gross leg edema) declined from grade 2 to grade 1 after surgery (P {\textless} .001). The limbs without any swelling increased from 12{\%} before stenting to 47{\%} after stenting (P {\textless} .01). The pain level recorded on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10 declined from a median level of 4 to 0 after stent placement (P {\textless} .001). The limbs that were completely free of pain increased from 17{\%} before stenting to 71{\%} after stent placement (P {\textless} .001). Stasis dermatitis/ulceration was present in 69 limbs. The improvement in swelling and pain was similar in ulcerated and nonulceratcd limbs. The cumulative recurrence-free ulcer healing rate was 62{\%} at 24 months. The rate of ulcer healing was similar whether or not concomitant saphenous ablation was performed. Quality of life has significantly improved. Conclusion: The correction of iliac vein outflow obstruction with the placement of stents results in the significant relief of major symptoms of CVI. The procedure is minimally invasive, can be performed on an outpatient basis, has minimal complications with a high patency rate, and does not preclude subsequent open surgery for the correction of restenosis or the associated reflux. If these preliminary results are sustained for a long-term period, stent placement for the correction of iliac vein stenoses may represent a useful advance in the management of CVI.

Biological molecules interact tightly, and should therefore coevolve as well. Here we review the literature about molecular coevolution, between residues within RNAs or proteins, and between proteins. A panel of methodological and bioinformatic approaches have been developed to address this issue, yielding contrasting results: a strong coevolutionary signal is detected in RNA stems, whereas proteins show only moderate, uneasy to interpret departure from the independence hypothesis. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.},

abstract = {A number of fundamental mathematical models of the evolutionary process exhibit dynamics that can be difficult to understand analytically. Here we show that a precise mathematical analogy can be drawn between certain evolutionary and thermodynamic systems, allowing application of the powerful machinery of statistical physics to analysis of a family of evolutionary models. Analytical results that follow directly from this approach include the steady-state distribution of fixed genotypes and the load in finite populations. The analogy with statistical physics also reveals that, contrary to a basic tenet of the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, the frequencies of adaptive and deleterious substitutions at steady state are equal. Finally, just as the free energy function quantitatively characterizes the balance between energy and entropy, a free fitness function provides an analytical expression for the balance between natural selection and stochastic drift.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show differential expression across breast cancer subtypes, and have both oncogenic and tumour-suppressive roles. Here we report the miRNA expression profiles of 1,302 breast tumours with matching detailed clinical annotation, long-term follow-up and genomic and messenger RNA expression data. This provides a comprehensive overview of the quantity, distribution and variation of the miRNA population and provides information on the extent to which genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional events contribute to miRNA expression architecture, suggesting an important role for post-transcriptional regulation. The key clinical parameters and cellular pathways related to the miRNA landscape are characterized, revealing context-dependent interactions, for example with regards to cell adhesion and Wnt signalling. Notably, only prognostic miRNA signatures derived from breast tumours devoid of somatic copy-number aberrations (CNA-devoid) are consistently prognostic across several other subtypes and can be validated in external cohorts. We then use a data-driven approach to seek the effects of miRNAs associated with differential co-expression of mRNAs, and find that miRNAs act as modulators of mRNA-mRNA interactions rather than as on-off molecular switches. We demonstrate such an important modulatory role for miRNAs in the biology of CNA-devoid breast cancers, a common subtype in which the immune response is prominent. These findings represent a new framework for studying the biology of miRNAs in human breast cancer.},

Thirty years later, I am still a devout Bayesian in the sense of (i), but I now doubt the wisdom of (ii) and I know that, in general, (iii) is false. Like most Bayesians, I believe that the knowledge we carry in our skulls, be its origin experience, schooling or hearsay, is an invaluable resource in all human activity, and that combining this knowledge with empirical data is the key to scientiﬁc enquiry and intelligent behavior. Thus, in this broad sense, I am a still Bayesian. However, in order to be combined with data, our knowledge must ﬁrst be cast in some formal language, and what I have come to realize in the past ten years is that the language of probability is not suitable for the task; the bulk of human knowledge is organized around causal, not probabilistic relationships, and the grammar of probability calculus is insufﬁcient for capturing those relationships. Speciﬁcally, the building blocks of our scientiﬁc and everyday knowledge are elementary facts such as mud does not cause rain and symptoms do not cause disease and those facts, strangely enough, cannot be expressed in the vocabulary of probability calculus. It is for this reason that I consider myself only a half-Bayesian.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that are {\~{}}22-nt-long sequences capable of suppressing protein synthesis. Previous research has suggested that miRNAs regulate 30{\%} or more of the human protein-coding genes. The aim of this work is to consider various analyzing scenarios in the identification of miRNA-target interactions, as well as to provide an integrated system that will aid in facilitating investigation on the influence of miRNA targets by alternative splicing and the biological function of miRNAs in biological pathways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: This work presents an integrated system, miRTar, which adopts various analyzing scenarios to identify putative miRNA target sites of the gene transcripts and elucidates the biological functions of miRNAs toward their targets in biological pathways. The system has three major features. First, the prediction system is able to consider various analyzing scenarios (1 miRNA:1 gene, 1:N, N:1, N:M, all miRNAs:N genes, and N miRNAs: genes involved in a pathway) to easily identify the regulatory relationships between interesting miRNAs and their targets, in 3'UTR, 5'UTR and coding regions. Second, miRTar can analyze and highlight a group of miRNA-regulated genes that participate in particular KEGG pathways to elucidate the biological roles of miRNAs in biological pathways. Third, miRTar can provide further information for elucidating the miRNA regulation, i.e., miRNA-target interactions, affected by alternative splicing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In this work, we developed an integrated resource, miRTar, to enable biologists to easily identify the biological functions and regulatory relationships between a group of known/putative miRNAs and protein coding genes. miRTar is now available at http://miRTar.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.},

To unravel the underlying features of energy parsing along allosteric pathways in voltage-gated K(+) channels, high-order thermodynamic coupling analysis was performed. We report that such allosteric trajectories are functionally conserved and delineated by well defined boundaries. Moreover, allosteric trajectories assume a hierarchical organization whereby increasingly stronger layers of cooperative residue interactions act to ensure efficient and cooperative long-range coupling between distal channel regions. Such long-range communication is brought about by a coupling of local and global conformational changes, suggesting that the allosteric trajectory also corresponds to a pathway of physical deformation. Supported by theoretical analyses and analogy to studies analyzing the contribution of long-range residue coupling to protein stability, we propose that such experimentally derived trajectory features are a general property of allosterically regulated proteins.},

abstract = {A computer program that progressively evaluates the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein along its amino acid sequence has been devised. For this purpose, a hydropathy scale has been composed wherein the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each of the 20 amino acid side-chains is taken into consideration. The scale is based on an amalgam of experimental observations derived from the literature. The program uses a moving-segment approach that continuously determines the average hydropathy within a segment of predetermined length as it advances through the sequence. The consecutive scores are plotted from the amino to the carboxy terminus. At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure. Although the method is not unique and embodies principles that have long been appreciated, its simplicity and its graphic nature make it a very useful tool for the evaluation of protein structures. ?? 1982.},

abstract = {Interactions of the three transported Na ions with the Na/K pump remain incompletely understood. Na/K pump crystal structures show that the extended C terminus of the Na,K-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) alpha subunit directly contacts transmembrane helices. Deletion of the last five residues (KETYY in almost all Na/K pumps) markedly lowered the apparent affinity for Na activation of pump phosphorylation from ATP, a reflection of cytoplasmic Na affinity for forming the occluded E1P(Na3) conformation. ATPase assays further suggested that C-terminal truncations also interfere with low affinity Na interactions, which are attributable to extracellular effects. Because extracellular Na ions traverse part of the membrane's electric field to reach their binding sites in the Na/K pump, their movements generate currents that can be monitored with high resolution. We report here electrical measurements to examine how Na/K pump interactions with extracellular Na ions are influenced by C-terminal truncations. We deleted the last two (YY) or five (KESYY) residues in Xenopus laevis alpha1 Na/K pumps made ouabain resistant by either of two kinds of point mutations and measured their currents as 10-mM ouabain-sensitive currents in Xenopus oocytes after silencing endogenous Xenopus Na/K pumps with 1 microM ouabain. We found the low affinity inhibitory influence of extracellular Na on outward Na/K pump current at negative voltages to be impaired in all of the C-terminally truncated pumps. Correspondingly, voltage jump-induced transient charge movements that reflect pump interactions with extracellular Na ions were strongly shifted to more negative potentials; this signals a several-fold reduction of the apparent affinity for extracellular Na in the truncated pumps. Parallel lowering of Na affinity on both sides of the membrane argues that the C-terminal contacts provide important stabilization of the occluded E1P(Na3) conformation, regardless of the route of Na ion entry into the binding pocket. Gating measurements of palytoxin-opened Na/K pump channels additionally imply that the C-terminal contacts also help stabilize pump conformations with occluded K ions.},

Methods are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays, SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated FDR of 12{\%}, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84{\%} by using conventional methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision repair genes were induced, suggesting that this repair pathway for UV-damaged DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in repairing DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.},

Furthermore, this approach is optimal in the sense of$\backslash$nmaximizing predictive ability.

We argue$\backslash$nthat the standard Bayesian formalism is unsatisfactory and propose an$\backslash$nalternative Bayesian approach that, we contend, takes full account of$\backslash$nthe true model uncertainty by averaging over a much smaller set of$\backslash$nmodels.

abstract = {Genetic mosaics provide information about cellular lineages that is otherwise difficult to obtain, especially in humans. De novo mutations act as cell markers, allowing the tracing of developmental trajectories of all descendants of the cell in which the new mutation arises. De novo mutations may arise at any time during development but are relatively rare. They have usually been observed through medical ascertainment, when the mutation causes unusual clinical signs or symptoms. Mutational events can include aneuploidies, large chromosomal rearrangements, copy number variants, or point mutations. In this review we focus primarily on the analysis of point mutations and their utility in addressing questions of germ line versus somatic lineages. Genetic mosaics demonstrate that the germ line and soma diverge early in development, since there are many examples of combined somatic and germ line mosaicism for de novo mutations. The occurrence of simultaneous mosaicism in both the germ line and soma also shows that the germ line is not strictly clonal but arises from at least two, and possibly multiple, cells in the embryo with different ancestries. Whole genome or exome DNA sequencing technologies promise to expand the range of studies of genetic mosaics, as de novo mutations can now be identified through sequencing alone in the absence of a medical ascertainment. These technologies have been used to study mutation patterns in nuclear families and in monozygotic twins, and in animal model developmental studies, but not yet for extensive cell lineage studies in humans.},

  abstract = {2,3-Benzodiazepines represent a family of specific, noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonists with anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties. In this study, the antiexcitotoxic potency of the clinical antiepileptic drug candidate, talampanel (4??2mg/kg), and that of two related 2,3-benzodiazepines, 5-(4-aminophenyl)-8-methyl-9H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466) (4??10mg/kg) and GYKI 53784 (4??2mg/kg), was investigated in 7-day-old rats. The AMPA antagonists were applied in four consecutive i.p. injections at 1-h intervals, the first dosage was given shortly after the intrastriatal injection of (S)-??-amino-3-hydroxy-5,7-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) (2.5nmol). All tested compounds protected animals from brain damage induced by AMPA as assessed 5 days later by using a tissue volume determination method based on computer-aided serial section reconstruction. GYKI 53784 (56.1??5.0{\%} protection) and talampanel (42.5??5.3{\%} protection) were more potent neuroprotective agents than GYKI 52466 (21.8??2.8{\%} protection). Furthermore, the three compounds attenuated the unilateral AMPA injection-induced turning behavior and seizure-like events. Our present findings are in agreement with those of other investigators who found talampanel neuroprotective in various in vivo experimental models. These data indicate that besides being a promising antiepileptic drug candidate talampanel may have a value in the pharmacotherapy of acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, including perinatal ischemia/hypoxia-induced brain injuries, as well. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small (19-25 nt) non-coding RNAs. This important class of gene regulator downregulates gene expression through sequence-specific binding to the 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of target mRNAs. Several computational target prediction approaches have been developed for predicting miRNA targets. However, the predicted target lists often have high false positive rates. To construct a workable target list for subsequent experimental studies, we need novel approaches to properly rank the candidate targets from traditional methods. We performed a systematic analysis of experimentally validated miRNA targets using functional genomics data, and found significant functional associations between genes that were targeted by the same miRNA. Based on this finding, we developed a miRNA target prioritization method named mirTarPri to rank the predicted target lists from commonly used target prediction methods. Leave-one-out cross validation has proved to be successful in identifying known targets, achieving an AUC score up to 0. 84. Validation in high-throughput data proved that mirTarPri was an unbiased method. Applying mirTarPri to prioritize results of six commonly used target prediction methods allowed us to find more positive targets at the top of the prioritized candidate list. In comparison with other methods, mirTarPri had an outstanding performance in gold standard and CLIP data. mirTarPri was a valuable method to improve the efficacy of current miRNA target prediction methods. We have also developed a web-based server for implementing mirTarPri method, which is freely accessible at http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/mirTarPri.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

Here we detail a multistep procedure for identifying potential key drivers of complex traits that integrates DNA-variation and gene-expression data with other complex trait data in segregating mouse populations. Ordering gene expression traits relative to one another and relative to other complex traits is achieved by systematically testing whether variations in DNA that lead to variations in relative transcript abundances statistically support an independent, causative or reactive function relative to the complex traits under consideration. We show that this approach can predict transcriptional responses to single gene-perturbation experiments using gene-expression data in the context of a segregating mouse population. We also demonstrate the utility of this approach by identifying and experimentally validating the involvement of three new genes in susceptibility to obesity.},

They are involved in a wide array of biological processes including cell differentiation, development, cell death and homeostasis, and fine-tune the regulation of these pathways. Their aberrant expressions have been associated with different diseases. These small RNAs are also known to function as oncogenes, oncosupressor genes, modulators of metastatic spread, and regulators of cancer stem cells. Their deregulation is a hallmark of different cancers types including breast cancer. Despite the growing evidence for their involvement in breast cancer, understanding the interplay between miRNAs and their targets leading to the disease remains largely unknown. Here, we provide a comprehensive story on miRNA signatures of breast cancer, miRNAs in breast cancer stem cells, metastamirs (i.e., metastasis regulatory miRNAs), circulating miRNAs as invasive blood-based biomarkers, and oncomiRs and oncosupressor miRNAs associated with breast cancer. Furthermore, we provide biological insights on their regulation by various mechanisms including genomic alterations and demonstration of a complicated feedback network between miRNAs and epigenetic regulators forming an epigenetics-miRNA regulatory circuit whose disruption may underlie the cause of breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the patterns of co-substitutions in RNA is now well characterized, detection of coevolving positions in proteins remains a difficult task. It has been recognized that the signal is typically weak, due to the fact that (i) amino-acid are characterized by various biochemical properties, so that distinct amino acids changes are not functionally equivalent, and (ii) a given mutation can be compensated by more than one mutation, at more than one position. RESULTS: We present a new method based on phylogenetic substitution mapping. The two above-mentioned problems are addressed by (i) the introduction of a weighted mapping, which accounts for the biochemical effects (volume, polarity, charge) of amino-acid changes, (ii) the use of a clustering approach to detect groups of coevolving sites of virtually any size, and (iii) the distinction between biochemical compensation and other coevolutionary mechanisms. We apply this methodology to a previously studied data set of bacterial ribosomal RNA, and to three protein data sets (myoglobin of vertebrates, S-locus Receptor Kinase and Methionine Amino-Peptidase). CONCLUSION: We succeed in detecting groups of sites which significantly depart the null hypothesis of independence. Group sizes range from pairs to groups of size approximately 10, depending on the substitution weights used. The structural and functional relevance of these groups of sites are assessed, and the various evolutionary processes potentially generating correlated substitution patterns are discussed.},

We now use an unbiased, high-throughput approach to identify genomic regions harboring recurrent DSBs in primary neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). We identify 27 recurrent DSB clusters (RDCs), and remarkably, all occur within gene bodies. Most of these NSPC RDCs were detected only upon mild, aphidicolin-induced replication stress, providing a nucleotide-resolution view of replication-associated genomic fragile sites. The vast majority of RDCs occur in long, transcribed, and late-replicating genes. Moreover, almost 90{\%} of identified RDC-containing genes are involved in synapse function and/or neural cell adhesion, with a substantial fraction also implicated in tumor suppression and/or mental disorders. Our characterization of NSPC RDCs reveals a basis of gene fragility and suggests potential impacts of DNA breaks on neurodevelopment and neural functions.},

abstract = {Somatic variant analysis of a tumour sample and its matched normal has been widely used in cancer research to distinguish germline polymorphisms from somatic mutations. However, due to the extensive intratumour heterogeneity of cancer, sequencing data from a single tumour sample may greatly underestimate the overall mutational landscape. In recent studies, multiple spatially or temporally separated tumour samples from the same patient were sequenced to identify the regional distribution of somatic mutations and study intratumour heterogeneity. There are a number of tools to perform somatic variant calling from matched tumour-normal next-generation sequencing (NGS) data; however none of these allow joint analysis of multiple same-patient samples. We discuss the benefits and challenges of multisample somatic variant calling and present multiSNV, a software package for calling single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using NGS data from multiple same-patient samples. Instead of performing multiple pairwise analyses of a single tumour sample and a matched normal, multiSNV jointly considers all available samples under a Bayesian framework to increase sensitivity of calling shared SNVs. By leveraging information from all available samples, multiSNV is able to detect rare mutations with variant allele frequencies down to 3{\%} from whole-exome sequencing experiments.},

Biochemical analyses in cell lines confirmed that this network regulates established drivers of tumor initiation and subtype implementation, including PTEN, PDGFRA, RB1, VEGFA, STAT3, and RUNX1, suggesting that these interactions mediate crosstalk between canonical oncogenic pathways. siRNA silencing of 13 miR-mediated PTEN regulators, whose locus deletions are predictive of PTEN expression variability, was sufficient to downregulate PTEN in a 3???UTR-dependent manner and to increase tumor cell growth rates. Thus, miR-mediated interactions provide a mechanistic, experimentally validated rationale for the loss of PTEN expression in a large number of glioma samples with an intact PTEN locus. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Concomitantly, mutant cells displayed a 10-fold reduction in morphologically docked LDCVs. Moreover, acute overexpression of Munc18-1 in bovine chromaffin cells increased the amount of releasable vesicles and accelerated vesicle supply. We conclude that Munc18-1 functions upstream of SNARE complex formation and promotes LDCV docking.},

Here we describe a complementary approach that seeks to identify healthy individuals resilient to highly penetrant forms of genetic childhood disorders. A comprehensive screen of 874 genes in 589,306 genomes led to the identification of 13 adults harboring mutations for 8 severe Mendelian conditions, with no reported clinical manifestation of the indicated disease. Our findings demonstrate the promise of broadening genetic studies to systematically search for well individuals who are buffering the effects of rare, highly penetrant, deleterious mutations. They also indicate that incomplete penetrance for Mendelian diseases is likely more common than previously believed. The identification of resilient individuals may provide a first step toward uncovering protective genetic variants that could help elucidate the mechanisms of Mendelian diseases and new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {A key step in the elimination of pathogens from the body is the covalent binding of complement proteins C3 and C4 to their surfaces. Proteolytic activation of these proteins results in a conformational change, and an internal thioester is exposed which reacts with amino or hydroxyl groups on the target surface to form amide or ester bonds, or is hydrolysed. We report here that the binding of the human C4A isotype involves a direct reaction between amino-nucleophiles and the thioester. A two-step mechanism is used by the C4B isotype. The histidine at position 1,106(aspartic acid in C4A) first attacks the thioester to form an acyl-imidazole intermediate. The released thiol then acts as a base to catalyse the transfer of the acyl group to amino- and hydroxyl-nucleophiles, including water.},

abstract = {To investigate the evolutionary impact of protein structure, the experimentally determined tertiary structure and the protein-coding DNA sequence were collected for each of 1,195 genes. These genes were studied via a model of sequence change that explicitly incorporates effects on evolutionary rates due to protein tertiary structure. In the model, these effects act via the solvent accessibility environments and pairwise amino acid interactions that are induced by tertiary structure. To compare the hypotheses that structure does and does not have a strong influence on evolution, Bayes factors were estimated for each of the 1,195 sequences. Most of the Bayes factors strongly support the hypothesis that protein structure affects protein evolution. Furthermore, both solvent accessibility and pairwise interactions among amino acids are inferred to have important roles in protein evolution. Our results also indicate that the strength of the relationship between tertiary structure and evolution has a weak but real correlation to the annotation information in the Gene Ontology database. Although their influences on rates of evolution vary among protein families, we find that the mean impacts of solvent accessibility and pairwise interactions are about the same.},

Over the past years, rapid technological advances led by academic institutions and companies have continued to broaden NGS applications from research to the clinic. A recent crop of discoveries have highlighted the medical impact of NGS technologies on Mendelian and complex diseases, particularly cancer. However, the ever-increasing pace of NGS adoption presents enormous challenges in terms of data processing, storage, management and interpretation as well as sequencing quality control, which hinder the translation from sequence data into clinical practice. In this review, we first summarize the technical characteristics and performance of current NGS platforms. We further highlight advances in the applications of NGS technologies towards the development of clinical diagnostics and therapeutics. Common issues in NGS workflows are also discussed to guide the selection of NGS platforms and pipelines for specific research purposes. ?? 2012.},

There is a wide variety of experimental and in silico methods for target exploration, prediction and validation, but these methods are somewhat complementary and suffer from different biases. Because the profile of microRNA targets allows the definition of similarity over miRNAs, these different information sources result in highly heterogeneous similarities. We investigate the adoption of multiple kernel learning framework for the fusion of these similarities, specifically we apply it for miRNA prioritization in the one-class settings. We use the described methodology in breast cancer, illustrate its technological aspects and validate our results not just by the common leave-one-out cross validation, but with prospective evaluation as well.},

@article{Kolaczkowski:2004,
abstract = {All inferences in comparative biology depend on accurate estimates of evolutionary relationships. Recent phylogenetic analyses have turned away from maximum parsimony towards the probabilistic techniques of maximum likelihood and bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC). These probabilistic techniques represent a parametric approach to statistical phylogenetics, because their criterion for evaluating a topology--the probability of the data, given the tree--is calculated with reference to an explicit evolutionary model from which the data are assumed to be identically distributed. Maximum parsimony can be considered nonparametric, because trees are evaluated on the basis of a general metric--the minimum number of character state changes required to generate the data on a given tree--without assuming a specific distribution. The shift to parametric methods was spurred, in large part, by studies showing that although both approaches perform well most of the time, maximum parsimony is strongly biased towards recovering an incorrect tree under certain combinations of branch lengths, whereas maximum likelihood is not. All these evaluations simulated sequences by a largely homogeneous evolutionary process in which data are identically distributed. There is ample evidence, however, that real-world gene sequences evolve heterogeneously and are not identically distributed. Here we show that maximum likelihood and BMCMC can become strongly biased and statistically inconsistent when the rates at which sequence sites evolve change non-identically over time. Maximum parsimony performs substantially better than current parametric methods over a wide range of conditions tested, including moderate heterogeneity and phylogenetic problems not normally considered difficult.},

abstract = {The repression of competition by mechanisms of policing is now recognized as a major force in the maintenance of cooperation. General models on the evolution of policing have focused on the interplay between individual competitiveness and mutual policing, demonstrating a positive relationship between within-group diversity and levels of policing. We expand this perspective by investigating what is possibly the simplest example of reproductive policing: copy number control (CNC) among non-conjugative plasmids, a class of extra-chromosomal vertically transmitted molecular symbionts of bacteria. Through the formulation and analysis of a multi-scale dynamical model, we show that the establishment of stable reproductive restraint among plasmids requires the co-evolution of two fundamental plasmid traits: policing, through the production of plasmid-coded trans-acting replication inhibitors, and obedience, expressed as the binding affinity of plasmid-specific targets to those inhibitors. We explain the intrinsic replication instabilities that arise in the absence of policing and we show how these instabilities are resolved by the evolution of copy number control. Increasing levels of policing and obedience lead to improvements in group performance due to tighter control of local population size (plasmid copy number), delivering benefits both to plasmids, by reducing the risk of segregational loss and to the plasmid-host partnership, by increasing the rate of cell reproduction, and therefore plasmid vertical transmission.},

abstract = {ComiR is a web tool for combinatorial microRNA (miRNA) target prediction. Given an messenger RNA (mRNA) in human, mouse, fly or worm genomes, ComiR computes the potential of being targeted by a set of miRNAs, each of which can have zero, one or more targets on its 3'untranslated region. In determining the regulatory potential of an mRNA from a set of miRNAs, ComiR uses user-provided miRNA expression levels in a combination of appropriate thermodynamic modeling and machine learning techniques to make more accurate predictions. For each gene, ComiR returns the probability of being a functional target of a set of miRNAs, which depends on the relative miRNA expression levels. The tool provides a user-friendly interface to input a miRNA expression table containing many sample information and filter out the most relevant miRNAs. ComiR results can be downloaded or visualized on a table, which can then be used to select the most relevant targets and to compare the results obtained with different miRNA expression input. ComiR is freely available for academic use at http://www.benoslab.pitt.edu/comir/.},

abstract = {The assembly of four soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor domains into a complex is essential for membrane fusion. In most cases, the four SNARE-domains are encoded by separate membrane-targeted proteins. However, in the exocytotic pathway, two SNARE-domains are present in one protein, connected by a flexible linker. The significance of this arrangement is unknown. We characterized the role of the linker in SNAP-25, a neuronal SNARE, by using overexpression techniques in synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) null mouse chromaffin cells and fast electrophysiological techniques. We confirm that the palmitoylated linker-cysteines are important for membrane association. A SNAP-25 mutant without cysteines supported exocytosis, but the fusion rate was slowed down and the fusion pore duration prolonged. Using chimeric proteins between SNAP-25 and its ubiquitous homologue SNAP-23, we show that the cysteine-containing part of the linkers is interchangeable. However, a stretch of 10 hydrophobic and charged amino acids in the C-terminal half of the SNAP-25 linker is required for fast exocytosis and in its absence the calcium dependence of exocytosis is shifted toward higher concentrations. The SNAP-25 linker therefore might have evolved as an adaptation toward calcium triggering and a high rate of execution of the fusion process, those features that distinguish exocytosis from other membrane fusion pathways.},

abstract = {In metazoans, miRNAs regulate gene expression primarily through binding to target sites in the 3' UTRs (untranslated regions) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Cis-acting variants within, or close to, a gene are crucial in explaining the variability of gene expression measures. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3' UTRs of genes can affect the base-pairing between miRNAs and mRNAs, and hence disrupt existing target sites (in the reference sequence) or create novel target sites, suggesting a possible mechanism for cis regulation of gene expression. Moreover, because the alleles of different SNPs within a DNA sequence of limited length tend to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD), we hypothesize the variants of miRNA target sites caused by SNPs potentially function as bridges linking the documented cis-SNP markers to the expression of the associated genes. A large-scale analysis was herein performed to test this hypothesis. By systematically integrating multiple latest information sources, we found 21 significant gene-level SNP-involved miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation modules (SNP-MPRMs) in the form of SNP-miRNA-mRNA triplets in lymphocyte cell lines for the CEU and YRI populations. Among the cognate genes, six including ALG8, DGKE, GNA12, KLF11, LRPAP1, and MMAB are related to multiple genetic diseases such as depressive disorder and Type-II diabetes. Furthermore, we found that {\~{}}35{\%} of the documented transcript intensity-related cis-SNPs ({\~{}}950) in a recent publication are identical to, or in significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) (p{\textless}0.01) with, one or multiple SNPs located in miRNA target sites. Based on these associations (or identities), 69 significant exon-level SNP-MPRMs and 12 disease genes were further determined for two populations. These results provide concrete in silico evidence for the proposed hypothesis. The discovered modules warrant additional follow-up in independent laboratory studies.},

abstract = {Common human diseases result from the interplay of many genes and environmental factors. Therefore, a more integrative biology approach is needed to unravel the complexity and causes of such diseases. To elucidate the complexity of common human diseases such as obesity, we have analysed the expression of 23,720 transcripts in large population-based blood and adipose tissue cohorts comprehensively assessed for various phenotypes, including traits related to clinical obesity. In contrast to the blood expression profiles, we observed a marked correlation between gene expression in adipose tissue and obesity-related traits. Genome-wide linkage and association mapping revealed a highly significant genetic component to gene expression traits, including a strong genetic effect of proximal (cis) signals, with 50{\%} of the cis signals overlapping between the two tissues profiled. Here we demonstrate an extensive transcriptional network constructed from the human adipose data that exhibits significant overlap with similar network modules constructed from mouse adipose data. A core network module in humans and mice was identified that is enriched for genes involved in the inflammatory and immune response and has been found to be causally associated to obesity-related traits.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying coevolving positions in protein sequences has myriad applications, ranging from understanding and predicting the structure of single molecules to generating proteome-wide predictions of interactions. Algorithms for detecting coevolving positions can be classified into two categories: tree-aware, which incorporate knowledge of phylogeny, and tree-ignorant, which do not. Tree-ignorant methods are frequently orders of magnitude faster, but are widely held to be insufficiently accurate because of a confounding of shared ancestry with coevolution. We conjectured that by using a null distribution that appropriately controls for the shared-ancestry signal, tree-ignorant methods would exhibit equivalent statistical power to tree-aware methods. Using a novel t-test transformation of coevolution metrics, we systematically compared four tree-aware and five tree-ignorant coevolution algorithms, applying them to myoglobin and myosin. We further considered the influence of sequence recoding using reduced-state amino acid alphabets, a common tactic employed in coevolutionary analyses to improve both statistical and computational performance. RESULTS: Consistent with our conjecture, the transformed tree-ignorant metrics (particularly Mutual Information) often outperformed the tree-aware metrics. Our examination of the effect of recoding suggested that charge-based alphabets were generally superior for identifying the stabilizing interactions in alpha helices. Performance was not always improved by recoding however, indicating that the choice of alphabet is critical. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that t-test transformation of tree-ignorant metrics can be sufficient to control for patterns arising from shared ancestry.},

abstract = {Various approaches based on features extracted from protein sequences and often machine learning methods have been used in the prediction of protein folds. Finding an efficient technique for integrating these different protein features has received increasing attention. In particular, kernel methods are an interesting class of techniques for integrating heterogeneous data. Various methods have been proposed to fuse multiple kernels. Most techniques for multiple kernel learning focus on learning a convex linear combination of base kernels. In addition to the limitation of linear combinations, working with such approaches could cause a loss of potentially useful information.We design several techniques to combine kernel matrices by taking more involved, geometry inspired means of these matrices instead of convex linear combinations. We consider various sequence-based protein features including information extracted directly from position-specific scoring matrices and local sequence alignment. We evaluate our methods for classification on the SCOP PDB-40D benchmark dataset for protein fold recognition. The best overall accuracy on the protein fold recognition test set obtained by our methods is ∼ 86.7{\%}. This is an improvement over the results of the best existing approach. Moreover, our computational model has been developed by incorporating the functional domain composition of proteins through a hybridization model. It is observed that by using our proposed hybridization model, the protein fold recognition accuracy is further improved to 89.30{\%}. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of our approach on the protein remote homology detection problem by fusing multiple string kernels.The MATLAB code used for our proposed geometric kernel fusion frameworks are publicly available at http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/∼raf.vandebril/homepage/software/geomean.php?menu=5/.},

This is implemented in a package, Mykrobe predictor, for S. aureus and M. tuberculosis, running in under three minutes on a laptop from raw data. For S. aureus, we train and validate in 495/471 samples respectively, finding error rates comparable to gold-standard phenotypic methods, with sensitivity/specificity of 99.3{\%}/99.5{\%} across 12 drugs. For M. tuberculosis, we identify species and predict resistance with specificity of 98.5{\%} (training/validating on 1920/1609 samples). Sensitivity of 82.6{\%} is limited by current understanding of genetic mechanisms. We also show that analysis of minor populations increases power to detect phenotypic resistance in second-line drugs without appreciable loss of specificity.

abstract = {This report is one of a series of papers that introduce and use a new and highly simplified treatment of protein conformations. The first paper (Levitt {\&} Warshel, 1975) outlined the approach and showed how it could be used to simulate the "renaturation" of a small protein. The present paper describes the representation in some detail and tests the methods extensively under a variety of different conditions. The third paper (Warshel {\&} Levitt, 1976) is devoted to a study of the folding pathway and stability of a mainly $\alpha$-helical protein. In this work, I show how the concept of time-averaged forces, introduced previously (Levitt {\&} Warshel, 1975), can be used to simplify conformational energy calculations on globular proteins. A detailed description is given of the simplified molecular geometry, the parameterization of suitable force fields, the best energy minimization procedure, and the techniques for escaping from local minima. Extensive tests of the method on the native conformation of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor show that the simplifications work well in representing the stable native conformation of this globular protein. Further tests show that simulated folding of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor from open chain conformations gives compact calculated conformations that have many features in common with the actual native conformation. Folding simulations are done under a variety of conditions, and the relevance of such calculations to the actual in vitro folding process is discussed at some length. These same techniques have many potential applications including enzyme-substrate binding, changes in protein tertiary and quaternary structure, and protein-protein interactions. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {We describe a new program for the alignment of multiple biological sequences that is both statistically motivated and fast enough for problem sizes that arise in practice. Our Fast Statistical Alignment program is based on pair hidden Markov models which approximate an insertion/deletion process on a tree and uses a sequence annealing algorithm to combine the posterior probabilities estimated from these models into a multiple alignment. FSA uses its explicit statistical model to produce multiple alignments which are accompanied by estimates of the alignment accuracy and uncertainty for every column and character of the alignment--previously available only with alignment programs which use computationally-expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo approaches--yet can align thousands of long sequences. Moreover, FSA utilizes an unsupervised query-specific learning procedure for parameter estimation which leads to improved accuracy on benchmark reference alignments in comparison to existing programs. The centroid alignment approach taken by FSA, in combination with its learning procedure, drastically reduces the amount of false-positive alignment on biological data in comparison to that given by other methods. The FSA program and a companion visualization tool for exploring uncertainty in alignments can be used via a web interface at http://orangutan.math.berkeley.edu/fsa/, and the source code is available at http://fsa.sourceforge.net/.},

abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters move solutes across membranes and are associated with important diseases, including cystic fibrosis and multi-drug resistance. These molecular machines are energized by their charateristic ABC modules, molecular engines fuelled by ATP hydrolysis. A solution NMR study of a model ABC, Methanococcus jannaschii protein MJ1267, reveals that ADP-Mg binding alters the flexibilities of key ABC motifs and induces allosteric changes in conformational dynamics in the LivG insert, over 30A away from the ATPase active site. (15)N spin relaxation data support a "selected-fit" model for nucleotide binding. Transitions between rigidity and flexibility in key motifs during the ATP hydrolysis cycle may be crucial to mechanochemical energy transduction in ABC transporters. The restriction of correlated protein motions is likely a central mechanism for allosteric communications. Comparison between dynamics data from NMR and X-ray crystallography reveals their overall consistency and complementarity.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs), i.e. small non-coding RNA molecules (∼22 nt), can bind to one or more target sites on a gene transcript to negatively regulate protein expression, subsequently controlling many cellular mechanisms. A current and curated collection of miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) with experimental support is essential to thoroughly elucidating miRNA functions under different conditions and in different species. As a database, miRTarBase has accumulated more than 3500 MTIs by manually surveying pertinent literature after data mining of the text systematically to filter research articles related to functional studies of miRNAs. Generally, the collected MTIs are validated experimentally by reporter assays, western blot, or microarray experiments with overexpression or knockdown of miRNAs. miRTarBase curates 3576 experimentally verified MTIs between 657 miRNAs and 2297 target genes among 17 species. miRTarBase contains the largest amount of validated MTIs by comparing with other similar, previously developed databases. The MTIs collected in the miRTarBase can also provide a large amount of positive samples to develop computational methods capable of identifying miRNA-target interactions. miRTarBase is now available on http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/, and is updated frequently by continuously surveying research articles.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants robustly associated with complex traits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations.},

abstract = {Most bioinformatics coursework focuses on algorithms, with perhaps some components devoted to learning programming skills and learning how to use existing bioinformatics software. Unfortunately, for students who are preparing for a research career, this type of curriculum fails to address many of the day-to-day organizational challenges associated with performing computational experiments. In practice, the principles behind organizing and documenting computational experiments are often learned on the fly, and this learning is strongly influenced by personal predilections as well as by chance interactions with collaborators or colleagues. The purpose of this article is to describe one good strategy for carrying out computational experiments. I will not describe profound issues such as how to formulate hypotheses, design experiments, or draw conclusions. Rather, I will focus on relatively mundane issues such as organizing files and directories and documenting progress. These issues are important because poor organizational choices can lead to significantly slower research progress. I do not claim that the strategies I outline here are optimal. These are simply the principles and practices that I have developed over 12 years of bioinformatics research, augmented with various suggestions from other researchers with whom I have discussed these issues.},

abstract = {Author SummaryDeletion of a single residue, phenylalanine at position 508, in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) is present in approximately 90{\%} of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Experiments show that this mutant protein exhibits inefficient biosynthetic maturation and susceptibility to degradation probably due to misfolding of NBD1 and the resultant incorrect interactions of other domains. However, little is known about the direct effect of the Phe508 deletion on NBD1 folding. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of NBD1-WT, NBD1-F508A, and NBD1-$\Delta$F508, we show that the deletion of Phe508 indeed alters the kinetics of NBD1 folding. We also find that the intermediate states appearing on wild type and mutant folding pathways are populated differently and that their kinetic accessibilities are distinct. Moreover, we identified critical interactions not necessarily localized near position 508, such as Q493/P574 and F575/F587, to be significant structural elements influencing the kinetic difference between wild type and mutant NBD1. We propose that these observed alterations in folding kinetics of mutant NBD1 result in misassembly of the whole multi-domain protein, thereby causing its premature degradation.},

abstract = {Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16{\%} of all breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36{\%} of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.},

abstract = {Correct repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is critical for maintaining genome stability. Whereas gene conversion (GC)-mediated repair is mostly error-free, repair by break-induced replication (BIR) is associated with non-reciprocal translocations and loss of heterozygosity. We have previously shown that a Recombination Execution Checkpoint (REC) mediates this competition by preventing the BIR pathway from acting on DSBs that can be repaired by GC. Here, we asked if the REC can also determine whether the ends that are engaged in a GC-compatible configuration belong to the same break, since repair involving ends from different breaks will produce potentially deleterious translocations. We report that the kinetics of repair are markedly delayed when the two DSB ends that participate in GC belong to different DSBs (termed Trans) compared to the case when both DSB ends come from the same break (Cis). However, repair in Trans still occurs by GC rather than BIR, and the overall efficiency of repair is comparable. Hence, the REC is not sensitive to the "origin" of the DSB ends. When the homologous ends for GC are in Trans, the delay in repair appears to reflect their tethering to sequences on the other side of the DSB that themselves recombine with other genomic locations with which they share sequence homology. These data support previous observations that the two ends of a DSB are usually tethered to each other and that this tethering facilitates both ends encountering the same donor sequence. We also found that the presence of homeologous/repetitive sequences in the vicinity of a DSB can distract the DSB end from finding its bona fide homologous donor, and that inhibition of GC by such homeologous sequences is markedly increased upon deleting Sgs1 but not Msh6.},

The Bioperl modules have been successfully and repeatedly used to reduce otherwise complex tasks to only a few lines of code. The Bioperl object model has been proven to be flexible enough to support enterprise-level applications such as EnsEMBL, while maintaining an easy learning curve for novice Perl programmers. Bioperl is capable of executing analyses and processing results from programs such as BLAST, ClustalW, or the EMBOSS suite. Interoperation with modules written in Python and Java is supported through the evolving BioCORBA bridge. Bioperl provides access to data stores such as GenBank and SwissProt via a flexible series of sequence input/output modules, and to the emerging common sequence data storage format of the Open Bioinformatics Database Access project. This study describes the overall architecture of the toolkit, the problem domains that it addresses, and gives specific examples of how the toolkit can be used to solve common life-sciences problems. We conclude with a discussion of how the open-source nature of the project has contributed to the development effort.},

abstract = {The Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) is a new sequencing platform that substantially differs from other sequencing technologies by measuring pH rather than light to detect polymerisation events. Using re-sequencing datasets, we comprehensively characterise the biases and errors introduced by the PGM at both the base and flow level, across a combination of factors, including chip density, sequencing kit, template species and machine. We found two distinct insertion/deletion (indel) error types that accounted for the majority of errors introduced by the PGM. The main error source was inaccurate flow-calls, which introduced indels at a raw rate of 2.84{\%} (1.38{\%} after quality clipping) using the OneTouch 200 bp kit. Inaccurate flow-calls typically resulted in over-called short-homopolymers and under-called long-homopolymers. Flow-call accuracy decreased with consecutive flow cycles, but we also found significant periodic fluctuations in the flow error-rate, corresponding to specific positions within the flow-cycle pattern. Another less common PGM error, high frequency indel (HFI) errors, are indels that occur at very high frequency in the reads relative to a given base position in the reference genome, but in the majority of instances were not replicated consistently across separate runs. HFI errors occur approximately once every thousand bases in the reference, and correspond to 0.06{\%} of bases in reads. Currently, the PGM does not achieve the accuracy of competing light-based technologies. However, flow-call inaccuracy is systematic and the statistical models of flow-values developed here will enable PGM-specific bioinformatics approaches to be developed, which will account for these errors. HFI errors may prove more challenging to address, especially for polymorphism and amplicon applications, but may be overcome by sequencing the same DNA template across multiple chips.},

To accommodate the wide variety of techniques and methodologies applied in current and future genotyping experiment, MIGen leverages foundational concepts from the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) for the description of the various types of planned processes and implements a hierarchical document structure. The adoption of MIGen by the research community will facilitate consistent genotyping data interpretation and independent data validation.

Inherited variants (copy number variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms) and acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) were associated with expression in {\~{}}40{\%} of genes, with the landscape dominated by cis- and trans-acting CNAs. By delineating expression outlier genes driven in cis by CNAs, we identified putative cancer genes, including deletions in PPP2R2A, MTAP and MAP2K4. Unsupervised analysis of paired DNA–RNA profiles revealed novel subgroups with distinct clinical outcomes, which reproduced in the validation cohort. These include a high-risk, oestrogen-receptor-positive 11q13/14 cis-acting subgroup and a favourable prognosis subgroup devoid of CNAs. Trans-acting aberration hotspots were found to modulate subgroup-specific gene networks, including a TCR deletion-mediated adaptive immune response in the ‘CNA-devoid' subgroup and a basal-specific chromosome 5 deletion-associated mitotic network. Our results provide a novel molecular stratification of the breast cancer population, derived from the impact of somatic CNAs on the transcriptome.},

We chart advances over the past several decades that address challenges of perception and action under uncertainty through the lens of computation. Advances include the development of representations and inferential procedures for large-scale probabilistic inference and machinery for enabling reflection and decisions about tradeoffs in effort, precision, and timeliness of computations. These tools are deployed toward the goal of computational rationality: identifying decisions with highest expected utility, while taking into consideration the costs of computation in complex real-world problems in which most relevant calculations can only be approximated. We highlight key concepts with examples that show the potential for interchange between computer science, cognitive science, and neuroscience.},

The pathogenesis of asthma is only partly understood, and there is an urgent need for improved therapeutic strategies for this disease. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network has considerable promise as a tool for discovery of novel asthma therapeutic targets and their relationship. Among the genes that have been identified by PPI studies, APP, CDKN1B, and SP3 displayed up-regulated expression. Further study depicted that CDKN1B localized in the nucleus or cytoplasm could interact with GRB2 and CASP8, but SP3 localized in the nucleus could interact with histone deacetylase 1, SP1, and E2F1. We anticipate that these types of analyses will provide considerable insight into asthma pathogenesis and will provide a wealth of new molecules for downstream analyses.},

@article{Gulyas-Kovacs:2006,
abstract = {SM proteins are essential elements in all mammalian fusion pathways. The yeast exocytotic SM protein sec-1 binds to the assembled SNARE complex, and may speed up SNARE complex formation. In contrast, the vertebrate exocytotic SM protein, Munc18-1, binds to syntaxin 1 in a conformation which is incompatible with SNARE complex formation. The physiological function of this interaction is controversial. We have investigated the function of syntaxin-binding by overexpression of Munc18-1 constructs in munc18-1 null mouse chromaffin cells. In these cells, docking of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane is impaired. Different Munc18-1 mutants (D34N/M38V and S313D) with reduced binding to syntaxin led to a partial restoration of the morphological docked vesicle pool. Electrophysiological data showed that the docked vesicles were fully functional, indicating intact priming and fusion reactions downstream of docking. Next, we evaluated whether Munc18 proteins might have roles downstream of docking, by overexpressing the Munc18-2 isoform in munc18-1 null cells. Munc18-2 binds strongly to syntaxin 1, but is expressed and functions together with syntaxin 3 in other cell types. We found that Munc18-2 could fully rescue the morphologically docked pool in munc18-1 null chromaffin cells but secretion was only restored to {\~{}}30{\%} of the Munc18-1 level. Kinetic analysis indicated that the fusion triggering reaction was normal in the presence of Munc18-2, identifying a Munc18-1-dependent step between docking and fusion of vesicles, i.e. at the priming stage. At this step Munc18-2 can only partially substitute for Munc18-1, even though docking is restored. These results indicate that the syntaxin-dependent function of Munc18-1 correlates with vesicle docking, and is located upstream of a second function of Munc18-1 in the vesicle priming reaction.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.

RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

abstract = {Acetylcholine receptor channels (AChRs) are proteins that switch between stable "closed" and "open" conformations. In patch clamp recordings, diliganded AChR gating appears to be a simple, two-state reaction. However, mutagenesis studies indicate that during gating dozens of residues across the protein move asynchronously and are organized into rigid body gating domains ("blocks"). Moreover, there is an upper limit to the apparent channel opening rate constant. These observations suggest that the gating reaction has a broad, corrugated transition state region, with the maximum opening rate reflecting, in part, the mean first-passage time across this ensemble. Simulations reveal that a flat, isotropic energy profile for the transition state can account for many of the essential features of AChR gating. With this mechanism, concerted, local structural transitions that occur on the broad transition state ensemble give rise to fractional measures of reaction progress (Phi values) determined by rate-equilibrium free energy relationship analysis. The results suggest that the coarse-grained AChR gating conformational change propagates through the protein with dynamics that are governed by the Brownian motion of individual gating blocks.},

abstract = {A direct approach to false discovery rates John D. Storey Stanford University, USA [Received June 2001. Revised December 2001] Summary. Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach--we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the BenjaminiHochberg FDR method.

However, in the lack of an unbiased whole-genome truth set, the global error rate of variant calls and the leading causal artifacts still remain unclear even given the great efforts in the evaluation of variant calling methods. RESULTS We made 10 single nucleotide polymorphism and INDEL call sets with two read mappers and five variant callers, both on a haploid human genome and a diploid genome at a similar coverage. By investigating false heterozygous calls in the haploid genome, we identified the erroneous realignment in low-complexity regions and the incomplete reference genome with respect to the sample as the two major sources of errors, which press for continued improvements in these two areas. We estimated that the error rate of raw genotype calls is as high as 1 in 10-15 kb, but the error rate of post-filtered calls is reduced to 1 in 100-200 kb without significant compromise on the sensitivity.

In this review, we have addressed the importance of the genetic variations in humans affecting miRNAs, their target genes and the genes involved in miRNA processing for individual risk of cancer, with particular emphasis on colorectal cancer. In fact, the number of studies suggesting that individual predisposition to cancer is modulated by genetic polymorphisms affecting the biogenesis of miRNA and the interaction between miRNAs and targets has risen steeply in the last few years. We also report the first evidence that variant alleles of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within miRNA genes and miRNA targets, previously associated with the risk of cancer, behave differently when tested in functional studies. The SNPs belonging to the miRNA world are certainly contributing to new insights in the field of the genetic predisposition to disease.},

It has been previously demonstrated that molecular dynamics using PHS is an efficient method to study peptide structure and dynamics in aqueous solution. Here, we extend the PHS approach to Monte Carlo simulations, whereby a stable shell of water molecules is maintained with a flexible, nonspherical, half-harmonic potential, tuned to maintain a constant restraining energy, with the difference between the restraint and shell energies used to dynamically adjust the shell radius. Examination of the shell and system size dependence of the restraining potential reveals its robustness. Moreover, its suitability for biomolecular simulations is evaluated using small spheres of water, hydration properties of small biological molecules, and configurational sampling of beta-hairpin pentapeptide YPGDV. This method, termed MC-PHS, appears to provide efficient representation of dominant solvation effects and should prove useful in the study of protein folding and design.},

Understanding these regulatory provides important clues to biological pathways that underlie diseases. In this paper, we propose a new statistical method, GroupRemMap, for identifying eQTLs. We model the relationship between gene expression and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) through multivariate linear regression models, in which gene expression levels are responses and SNV genotypes are predictors. To handle the high-dimensionality as well as to incorporate the intrinsic group structure of SNVs, we introduce a new regularization scheme to (1) control the overall sparsity of the model; (2) encourage the group selection of SNVs from the same gene; and (3) facilitate the detection of trans-hub-eQTLs. We apply the proposed method to the colorectal and breast cancer data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and identify several biologically interesting eQTLs. These findings may provide insight into biological processes associated with cancers and generate hypotheses for future studies.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), encoded by the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis patients, belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, but, unlike other members, functions as a chloride channel. CFTR is activated by protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of multiple sites in its regulatory domain, and gated by binding and hydrolysis of ATP at its two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1, NBD2). The recent crystal structure of NBD1 from mouse CFTR (Lewis, H.A., S.G. Buchanan, S.K. Burley, K. Conners, M. Dickey, M. Dorwart, R. Fowler, X. Gao, W.B. Guggino, W.A. Hendrickson, et al. 2004. EMBO J. 23:282-293) identified two regions absent from structures of all other NBDs determined so far, a "regulatory insertion" (residues 404-435) and a "regulatory extension" (residues 639-670), both positioned to impede formation of the putative NBD1-NBD2 dimer anticipated to occur during channel gating; as both segments appeared highly mobile and both contained consensus PKA sites (serine 422, and serines 660 and 670, respectively), it was suggested that their phosphorylation-linked conformational changes might underlie CFTR channel regulation. To test that suggestion, we coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes CFTR residues 1-414 with residues 433-1480, or residues 1-633 with 668-1480, to yield split CFTR channels (called 414+433 and 633+668) that lack most of the insertion, or extension, respectively. In excised patches, regulation of the resulting CFTR channels by PKA and by ATP was largely normal. Both 414+433 channels and 633+668 channels, as well as 633(S422A)+668 channels (lacking both the extension and the sole PKA consensus site in the insertion), were all shut during exposure to MgATP before addition of PKA, but activated like wild type (WT) upon phosphorylation; this indicates that inhibitory regulation of nonphosphorylated WT channels depends upon neither segment. Detailed kinetic analysis of 414+433 channels revealed intact ATP dependence of single-channel gating kinetics, but slightly shortened open bursts and faster closing from the locked-open state (elicited by ATP plus pyrophosphate or ATP plus AMPPNP). In contrast, 633+668 channel function was indistinguishable from WT at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. We conclude that neither nonconserved segment is an essential element of PKA- or nucleotide-dependent regulation.},

abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels comprise four pore-forming Kir6 and four regulatory sulphonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. SUR, an ATP-binding cassette protein, associates with Kir6 through its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0). TMD0 connects to the core domain of SUR through a cytosolic linker (L0). The intrinsic gating of Kir6.2 is greatly altered by SUR. It has been hypothesized that these changes are conferred by TMD0. Exploiting the fact that the pancreatic (SUR1/Kir6.2) and the cardiac (SUR2A/Kir6.2) K(ATP) channels show different gating behaviours, we have tested this hypothesis by comparing the intrinsic gating of Kir6.2 with the last 26 residues deleted (Kir6.2Delta26) co-expressed with SUR1, S1-TMD0, SUR2A and S2-TMD0 at -40 and -100 mV (S is an abbreviation for SUR; TMD0/Kir6.2Delta26, but not TMD0/Kir6.2, can exit the endoplastic reticulum and reach the cell membrane). Single-channel kinetic analyses revealed that the mean burst and interburst durations are shorter for TMD0/Kir6.2Delta26 than for the corresponding SUR channels. No differences were found between the two TMD0 channels. We further demonstrated that in isolation even TMD0-L0 (SUR truncated after L0) cannot confer the wild-type intrinsic gating to Kir6.2Delta26 and that swapping L0 (SUR truncated after L0)between SUR1 and SUR2A only partially exchanges their different intrinsic gating. Therefore, in addition to TMD0, L0 and the core domain also participate in determining the intrinsic gating of Kir6.2. However, TMD0 and L0 are responsible for the different gating patterns of full-length SUR1 and SUR2A channels. A kinetic model with one open and four closed states is presented to explain our results in a mechanistic context.},

abstract = {Cataloging the association of transcripts to genetic variants in recent years holds the promise for functional dissection of regulatory structure of human transcription. Here, we present a novel approach, which aims at elucidating the joint relationships between transcripts and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This entails detection and analysis of modules of transcripts, each weakly associated to a single genetic variant, together exposing a high-confidence association signal between the module and this 'main' SNP. To explore how transcripts in a module are related to causative loci for that module, we represent such dependencies by a graphical model. We applied our method to the existing data on genetics of gene expression in the liver. The modules are significantly more, larger and denser than found in permuted data. Quantification of the confidence in a module as a likelihood score, allows us to detect transcripts that do not reach genome-wide significance level. Topological analysis of each module identifies novel insights regarding the flow of causality between the main SNP and transcripts. We observe similar annotations of modules from two sources of information: the enrichment of a module in gene subsets and locus annotation of the genetic variants. This and further phenotypic analysis provide a validation for our methodology.},

In eukaryotes, these channels fulfill numerous biological roles requiring gated anion conductance, from regulating skeletal muscle excitability to facilitating endosomal acidification by (H+)ATPases. In prokaryotes, ClC functions are unknown except in Escherichia coli, where the ClC-ec1 protein promotes H+ extrusion activated in the extreme acid-resistance response common to enteric bacteria. Recently, the high-resolution structure of ClC-ec1 was solved by X-ray crystallography. This primal prokaryotic ClC structure has productively guided understanding of gating and anion permeation in the extensively studied eukaryotic ClC channels. We now show that this bacterial homologue is not an ion channel, but rather a H+-Cl- exchange transporter. As the same molecular architecture can support two fundamentally different transport mechanisms, it seems that the structural boundary separating channels and transporters is not as clear cut as generally thought.},

abstract = {Most phylogenetic models of protein evolution assume that sites are independent and identically distributed. Interactions between sites are ignored, and the likelihood can be conveniently calculated as the product of the individual site likelihoods. The calculation considers all possible transition paths (also called substitution histories or mappings) that are consistent with the observed states at the terminals, and the probability density of any particular reconstruction depends on the substitution model. The likelihood is the integral of the probability density of each substitution history taken over all possible histories that are consistent with the observed data. We investigated the extent to which transition paths that are incompatible with a protein's three-dimensional structure contribute to the likelihood. Several empirical amino acid models were tested for sequence pairs of different degrees of divergence. When simulating substitutional histories starting from a real sequence, the structural integrity of the simulated sequences quickly disintegrated. This result indicates that simple models are clearly unable to capture the constraints on sequence evolution. However, when we sampled transition paths between real sequences from the posterior probability distribution according to these same models, we found that the sampled histories were largely consistent with the tertiary structure. This suggests that simple empirical substitution models may be adequate for interpolating changes between observed sequences during phylogenetic inference despite the fact that the models cannot predict the effects of structural constraints from first principles. This study is significant because it provides a quantitative assessment of the biological realism of substitution models from the perspective of protein structure, and it provides insight on the prospects for improving models of protein sequence evolution.

Since at the mutational level SCPE is completely unbiased, any emergent sequence pattern will be due exclusively to structural constraints.

For many years, the molecular identity of the docked state, and especially the vesicular docking protein, has been unknown, as has the link to SNARE complex assembly. Here, using adrenal chromaffin cells, we identify the vesicular docking partner as synaptotagmin-1, the calcium sensor for exocytosis, and SNAP-25 as an essential plasma membrane docking factor, which, together with the previously known docking factors Munc18-1 and syntaxin, form the minimal docking machinery. Moreover, we show that the requirement for Munc18-1 in docking, but not fusion, can be overcome by stabilizing syntaxin/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes. These findings, together with cross-rescue, double-knockout, and electrophysiological data, lead us to propose that vesicles??dock when synaptotagmin-1 binds to syntaxin/SNAP-25 acceptor complexes, whereas Munc18-1 is required for the downstream association of synaptobrevin to form fusogenic SNARE complexes. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Because a single nucleotide change in the sequence of a target site can affect miRNA regulation, naturally occurring SNPs in target sites are candidates for functional variation that may be of interest for biomedical applications and evolutionary studies. However, little is known to date about variation among humans at miRNAs and their target sites. In this study, we analyzed publicly available SNP data in context with miRNAs and their target sites throughout the human genome, and we found a relatively low level of variation in functional regions of miRNAs, but an appreciable level of variation at target sites. Approximately 400 SNPs were found at experimentally verified target sites or predicted target sites that are otherwise evolutionarily conserved across mammals. Moreover, approximately 250 SNPs potentially create novel target sites for miRNAs in humans. If some variants have functional effects, they might confer phenotypic differences among humans. Although the majority of these SNPs appear to be evolving under neutrality, interestingly, some of these SNPs are found at relatively high population frequencies even in experimentally verified targets, and a few variants are associated with atypically long-range haplotypes that may have been subject to recent positive selection.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {Allostery offers a highly specific way to modulate protein function. Therefore, understanding this mechanism is of increasing interest for protein science and drug discovery. However, allosteric signal transmission is difficult to detect experimentally and to model because it is often mediated by local structural changes propagating along multiple pathways. To address this, we developed a method to identify communication pathways by an information-theoretical analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. Signal propagation was described as information exchange through a network of correlated local motions, modeled as transitions between canonical states of protein fragments. The method was used to describe allostery in two-component regulatory systems. In particular, the transmission from the allosteric site to the signaling surface of the receiver domain NtrC was shown to be mediated by a layer of hub residues. The location of hubs preferentially connected to the allosteric site was found in close agreement with key residues experimentally identified as involved in the signal transmission. The comparison with the networks of the homologues CheY and FixJ highlighted similarities in their dynamics. In particular, we showed that a preorganized network of fragment connections between the allosteric and functional sites exists already in the inactive state of all three proteins.-Pandini, A., Fornili, A., Fraternali, F., Kleinjung, J.

Thus, there is a pressing clinical need to improve early prevention and clinical management of T2D and its complications. Clinicians have understood that patients who carry the T2D diagnosis have a variety of phenotypes and susceptibilities to diabetes-related complications. We used a precision medicine approach to characterize the complexity of T2D patient populations based on high-dimensional electronic medical records (EMRs) and genotype data from 11,210 individuals. We successfully identified three distinct subgroups of T2D from topology-based patient-patient networks. Subtype 1 was characterized by T2D complications diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy; subtype 2 was enriched for cancer malignancy and cardiovascular diseases; and subtype 3 was associated most strongly with cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, allergies, and HIV infections. We performed a genetic association analysis of the emergent T2D subtypes to identify subtype-specific genetic markers and identified 1279, 1227, and 1338 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mapped to 425, 322, and 437 unique genes specific to subtypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. By assessing the human disease-SNP association for each subtype, the enriched phenotypes and biological functions at the gene level for each subtype matched with the disease comorbidities and clinical differences that we identified through EMRs. Our approach demonstrates the utility of applying the precision medicine paradigm in T2D and the promise of extending the approach to the study of other complex, multifactorial diseases.},

Their interdependence should be apparent in the evolutionary record of each protein family: positions in the sequence of a protein family that are intimately associated in space or in function should co-vary in evolution.

RESULTS: We present a quantitative algorithm for assessing covariation with this approach, based on explicit likelihood calculations. By applying our algorithm to 138 Pfam families with at least one member of known structure, we demonstrate that our method has improved power in finding physically close residues in crystal structures, compared to that of Ranganathan and colleagues.

abstract = {Microsatellite instability (MSI) is characterized by the expansion or contraction of DNA repeat tracts as a consequence of DNA mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD). Accurate detection of MSI in cancer cells is important since MSI is associated with several cancer subtypes and can help inform therapeutic decisions. Although experimental assays have been developed to detect MSI, they typically depend on a small number of known microsatellite loci or mismatch repair genes and have limited reliability. Here, we report a novel genome-wide approach for MSI detection based on the global detection of insertions and deletions (indels) in microsatellites found in expressed genes. Our large-scale analyses of 20 cancer cell lines and 123 normal individuals revealed striking indel features associated with MSI: there is a significant increase of short microsatellite deletions in MSI samples compared to microsatellite stable (MSS) ones, suggesting a mechanistic bias of repair efficiency between insertions and deletions in normal human cells. By incorporating this observation into our MSI scoring metric, we show that our approach can correctly distinguish between MSI and MSS cancer cell lines. Moreover, when we applied this approach to primal tumor samples, our metric is also well consistent with diagnosed MSI status.

abstract = {Four influenza pandemics have struck the human population during the last 100 years causing substantial morbidity and mortality. The pandemics were caused by the introduction of a new virus into the human population from an avian or swine host or through the mixing of virus segments from an animal host with a human virus to create a new reassortant subtype virus. Understanding which changes have contributed to the adaptation of the virus to the human host is essential in assessing the pandemic potential of current and future animal viruses. Here, we develop a measure of the level of adaptation of a given virus strain to a particular host. We show that adaptation to the human host has been gradual with a timescale of decades and that none of the virus proteins have yet achieved full adaptation to the selective constraints. When the measure is applied to historical data, our results indicate that the 1918 influenza virus had undergone a period of preadaptation prior to the 1918 pandemic. Yet, ancestral reconstruction of the avian virus that founded the classical swine and 1918 human influenza lineages shows no evidence that this virus was exceptionally preadapted to humans. These results indicate that adaptation to humans occurred following the initial host shift from birds to mammals, including a significant amount prior to 1918. The 2009 pandemic virus seems to have undergone preadaptation to human-like selective constraints during its period of circulation in swine. Ancestral reconstruction along the human virus tree indicates that mutations that have increased the adaptation of the virus have occurred preferentially along the trunk of the tree. The method should be helpful in assessing the potential of current viruses to found future epidemics or pandemics.},

abstract = {The completion of a draft sequence of the human genome and the promise of rapid single-nucleotide-polymorphism-genotyping technologies have resulted in a call for the abandonment of linkage studies in favor of genome scans for association. However, there exists a large class of genetic models for which this approach will fail: purely epistatic models with no additive or dominance variation at any of the susceptibility loci. As a result, traditional association methods (such as case/control, measured genotype, and transmission/disequilibrium test [TDT]) will have no power if the loci are examined individually. In this article, we examine this class of models, delimiting the range of genetic determination and recurrence risks for two-, three-, and four-locus purely epistatic models. Our study reveals that these models, although giving rise to no additive or dominance variation, do give rise to increased allele sharing between affected sibs. Thus, a genome scan for linkage could detect genomic subregions harboring susceptibility loci. We also discuss some simple multilocus extensions of single-locus analysis methods, including a conditional form of the TDT.},

  abstract      = {Schizophrenia is a common disease with a complex aetiology, probably involving multiple and heterogeneous genetic factors. Here, by analysing the exome sequences of 2,536 schizophrenia cases and 2,543 controls, we demonstrate a polygenic burden primarily arising from rare (less than 1 in 10,000), disruptive mutations distributed across many genes. Particularly enriched gene sets include the voltage-gated calcium ion channel and the signalling complex formed by the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein (ARC) of the postsynaptic density, sets previously implicated by genome-wide association and copy-number variation studies. Similar to reports in autism, targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP, product of FMR1) are enriched for case mutations. No individual gene-based test achieves significance after correction for multiple testing and we do not detect any alleles of moderately low frequency (approximately 0.5 to 1 per cent) and moderately large effect. Taken together, these data suggest that population-based exome sequencing can discover risk alleles and complements established gene-mapping paradigms in neuropsychiatric disease.},

@article{Chaves2015,
abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel opening and closing are driven by cycles of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding-induced formation and hydrolysis-triggered disruption of a heterodimer of its cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). Although both composite sites enclosed within the heterodimer interface contain ATP in an open CFTR channel, ATP hydrolysis in the sole catalytically competent site causes channel closure. Opening of the NBD interface at that site then allows ADP-ATP exchange. But how frequently, and how far, the NBD surfaces separate at the other, inactive composite site remains unclear. We assessed separation at each composite site by monitoring access of nucleotide-sized hydrophilic, thiol-specific methanothiosulfonate (MTS) reagents to interfacial target cysteines introduced into either LSGGQ-like ATP-binding cassette signature sequence (replacing equivalent conserved serines: S549 and S1347). Covalent MTS-dependent modification of either cysteine while channels were kept closed by the absence of ATP impaired subsequent opening upon ATP readdition. Modification while channels were opening and closing in the presence of ATP caused macroscopic CFTR current to decline at the same speed as when the unmodified channels shut upon sudden ATP withdrawal. These results suggest that the target cysteines can be modified only in closed channels; that after modification the attached MTS adduct interferes with ATP-mediated opening; and that modification in the presence of ATP occurs rapidly once channels close, before they can reopen. This interpretation was corroborated by the finding that, for either cysteine target, the addition of the hydrolysis-impairing mutation K1250R (catalytic site Walker A Lys) similarly slowed, by an order of magnitude, channel closing on ATP removal and the speed of modification by MTS reagent in ATP. We conclude that, in every CFTR channel gating cycle, the NBD dimer interface separates simultaneously at both composite sites sufficiently to allow MTS reagents to access both signature-sequence serines. Relatively rapid modification of S1347C channels by larger reagents-MTS-glucose, MTS-biotin, and MTS-rhodamine-demonstrates that, at the noncatalytic composite site, this separation must exceed 8 {\AA}.},

abstract = {Rate-equilibrium free energy relationship (REFER) analysis provides information on transition-state structures and has been applied to reveal the temporal sequence in which the different regions of an ion channel protein move during a closed-open conformational transition. To date, the theory used to interpret REFER relationships has been developed only for equilibrium mechanisms. Gating of most ion channels is an equilibrium process, but recently several ion channels have been identified to have retained nonequilibrium traits in their gating cycles, inherited from transporter-like ancestors. So far it has not been examined to what extent REFER analysis is applicable to such systems. By deriving the REFER relationships for a simple nonequilibrium mechanism, this paper addresses whether an equilibrium mechanism can be distinguished from a nonequilibrium one by the characteristics of their REFER plots, and whether information on the transition-state structures can be obtained from REFER plots for gating mechanisms that are known to be nonequilibrium cycles. The results show that REFER plots do not carry information on the equilibrium nature of the underlying gating mechanism. Both equilibrium and nonequilibrium mechanisms can result in linear or nonlinear REFER plots, and complementarity of REFER slopes for opening and closing transitions is a trivial feature true for any mechanism. Additionally, REFER analysis provides limited information about the transition-state structures for gating schemes that are known to be nonequilibrium cycles.},

It has therefore been proposed that the division of Homo sapiens into these groups is not justified by the genetic data. This conclusion, due to R.C. Lewontin in 1972, is unwarranted because the argument ignores the fact that most of the information that distinguishes populations is hidden in the correlation structure of the data and not simply in the variation of the individual factors. The underlying logic, which was discussed in the early years of the last century, is here discussed using a simple genetical example.},

However, little is known about the extent of their variability within the human population. Here, we characterise the extent, causes, and effects of naturally occurring variation in expression and sequence of small RNAs from adipose tissue in relation to genotype, gene expression, and metabolic traits in the MuTHER reference cohort. We profiled the expression of 15 to 30 base pair RNA molecules in subcutaneous adipose tissue from 131 individuals using high-throughput sequencing, and quantified levels of 591 microRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs. We identified three genetic variants and three RNA editing events. Highly expressed small RNAs are more conserved within mammals than average, as are those with highly variable expression. We identified 14 genetic loci significantly associated with nearby small RNA expression levels, seven of which also regulate an mRNA transcript level in the same region. In addition, these loci are enriched for variants significant in genome-wide association studies for body mass index. Contrary to expectation, we found no evidence for negative correlation between expression level of a microRNA and its target mRNAs. Trunk fat mass, body mass index, and fasting insulin were associated with more than twenty small RNA expression levels each, while fasting glucose had no significant associations. This study highlights the similar genetic complexity and shared genetic control of small RNA and mRNA transcripts, and gives a quantitative picture of small RNA expression variation in the human population.},

Research in the field of ecology suggests that an evolutionary double bind could be an effective way to treat tumors. In an evolutionary double bind two therapies are used in combination such that evolving resistance to one leaves individuals more susceptible to the other. In this paper we present a general evolutionary game theory framework of a double bind to study the effect that such an approach would have in cancer. Furthermore we use this mathematical framework to understand recent experimental results that suggest a synergistic effect between a p53 cancer vaccine and chemotherapy. Our model recapitulates the latest experimental data and provides an explanation for its effectiveness based on the commensalistic relationship between the tumor phenotypes.},

Several of the autosomal genes that undergo RMAE have independently been implicated in human Mendelian disorders. Thus, parsing the relationship between allele-specific expression of these genes and disease is of interest. Mutations in the human forkhead box P2 gene, FOXP2, cause developmental verbal dyspraxia with profound speech and language deficits. Here, we show that the human FOXP2 gene undergoes RMAE. Studying an individual with developmental verbal dyspraxia, we identify a deletion 3 Mb away from the FOXP2 gene, which impacts FOXP2 gene expression in cis. Together these data suggest the intriguing possibility that RMAE impacts the haploinsufficiency phenotypes observed for FOXP2 mutations.},

abstract = {The unique structural motifs and self-recognition properties of DNA can be exploited to generate self-assembling DNA nanostructures of specific shapes using a 'bottom-up' approach. Several assembly strategies have been developed for building complex three-dimensional (3D) DNA nanostructures. Recently, the DNA 'origami' method was used to build two-dimensional addressable DNA structures of arbitrary shape that can be used as platforms to arrange nanomaterials with high precision and specificity. A long-term goal of this field has been to construct fully addressable 3D DNA nanostructures. Here we extend the DNA origami method into three dimensions by creating an addressable DNA box 42 x 36 x 36 nm(3) in size that can be opened in the presence of externally supplied DNA 'keys'. We thoroughly characterize the structure of this DNA box using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy, and use fluorescence resonance energy transfer to optically monitor the opening of the lid. Controlled access to the interior compartment of this DNA nanocontainer could yield several interesting applications, for example as a logic sensor for multiple-sequence signals or for the controlled release of nanocargos.},

abstract = {Algorithms that must deal with complicated global functions of many variables often exploit the manner in which the given functions factor as a product of “local” functions, each of which depends on a subset of the variables. Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative “turbo” decoding algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms View full abstract},

abstract = {Four popular somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling methods (Varscan, SomaticSniper, Strelka and MuTect2) were carefully evaluated on the real whole exome sequencing (WES, depth of {\~{}}50X) and ultra-deep targeted sequencing (UDT-Seq, depth of {\~{}}370X) data. The four tools returned poor consensus on candidates (only 20{\%} of calls were with multiple hits by the callers). For both WES and UDT-Seq, MuTect2 and Strelka obtained the largest proportion of COSMIC entries as well as the lowest rate of dbSNP presence and high-alternative-alleles-in-control calls, demonstrating their superior sensitivity and accuracy. Combining different callers does increase reliability of candidates, but narrows the list down to very limited range of tumor read depth and variant allele frequency. Calling SNV on UDT-Seq data, which were of much higher read-depth, discovered additional true-positive variations, despite an even more tremendous growth in false positive predictions. Our findings not only provide valuable benchmark for state-of-the-art SNV calling methods, but also shed light on the access to more accurate SNV identification in the future.},

abstract = {The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is an important tool to gauge the performance of classifiers. In certain situations of high-throughput data analysis, the data is heavily class-skewed, i.e. most features tested belong to the true negative class. In such cases, only a small portion of the ROC curve is relevant in practical terms, rendering the ROC curve and its area under the curve (AUC) insufficient for the purpose of judging classifier performance. Here we define an ROC surface (ROCS) using true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and true discovery rate (TDR). The ROC surface, together with the associated quantities, volume under the surface (VUS) and FDR-controlled area under the ROC curve (FCAUC), provide a useful approach for gauging classifier performance on class-skewed high-throughput data. The implementation as an R package is available at http://userwww.service.emory.edu/{\~{}}tyu8/ROCS/.},

abstract = {How somatic mutations accumulate in normal cells is central to understanding cancer development but is poorly understood. We performed ultradeep sequencing of 74 cancer genes in small (0.8 to 4.7 square millimeters) biopsies of normal skin. Across 234 biopsies of sun-exposed eyelid epidermis from four individuals, the burden of somatic mutations averaged two to six mutations per megabase per cell, similar to that seen in many cancers, and exhibited characteristic signatures of exposure to ultraviolet light. Remarkably, multiple cancer genes are under strong positive selection even in physiologically normal skin, including most of the key drivers of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Positively selected mutations were found in 18 to 32{\%} of normal skin cells at a density of {\~{}}140 driver mutations per square centimeter. We observed variability in the driver landscape among individuals and variability in the sizes of clonal expansions across genes. Thus, aged sun-exposed skin is a patchwork of thousands of evolving clones with over a quarter of cells carrying cancer-causing mutations while maintaining the physiological functions of epidermis.},

We describe the design and application of a tool for multiple alignment of amino acid sequences that implements a new algorithm that greatly reduces the computational demands of dynamic programming. This tool is able to align in reasonable time as many as eight sequences the length of an average protein.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are likely to play an important role in the genetics of complex traits; however, their functional basis remains poorly understood. Using the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines, we combine 1000 Genomes genotypes and an extensive catalogue of human functional elements to investigate the biological mechanisms that eQTLs perturb.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We use a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the enrichment of eQTLs in a wide variety of regulatory annotations. We find that approximately 40{\%} of eQTLs occur in open chromatin, and that they are particularly enriched in transcription factor binding sites, suggesting that many directly impact protein-DNA interactions. Analysis of core promoter regions shows that eQTLs also frequently disrupt some known core promoter motifs but, surprisingly, are not enriched in other well-known motifs such as the TATA box. We also show that information from regulatory annotations alone, when weighted by the hierarchical model, can provide a meaningful ranking of the SNPs that are most likely to drive gene expression variation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates how regulatory annotation and the association signal derived from eQTL-mapping can be combined into a single framework. We used this approach to further our understanding of the biology that drives human gene expression variation, and of the putatively causal SNPs that underlie it.},

abstract = {Quantifying the differential expression of genes in various human organs, tissues, and cell types is vital to understand human physiology and disease. Recently, several large-scale transcriptomics studies have analyzed the expression of protein-coding genes across tissues. These datasets provide a framework for defining the molecular constituents of the human body as well as for generating comprehensive lists of proteins expressed across tissues or in a tissue-restricted manner. Here, we review publicly available human transcriptome resources and discuss body-wide data from independent genome-wide transcriptome analyses of different tissues. Gene expression measurements from these independent datasets, generated using samples from fresh frozen surgical specimens and postmortem tissues, are consistent. Overall, the different genome-wide analyses support a distribution in which many proteins are found in all tissues and relatively few in a tissue-restricted manner. Moreover, we discuss the applications of publicly available omics data for building genome-scale metabolic models, used for analyzing cell and tissue functions both in physiological and in disease contexts.},

abstract = {"Statistical potentials" are energies widely used in computer algorithms to fold, dock, or recognize protein structures. They are derived from: (1) observed pairing frequencies of the 20 amino acids in databases of known protein structures, and (2) approximations and assumptions about the physical process that these quantities measure. Using exact lattice models, we construct a rigorous test of those assumptions and approximations. We find that statistical potentials often correctly rank-order the relative strengths of interresidue interactions, but they do not reflect the true underlying energies because of systematic errors arising from the neglect of excluded volume in proteins. We find that complex residue-residue distance dependences observed in statistical potentials, even those among charged groups, can be largely explained as an indirect consequence of the burial of non-polar groups. Our results suggest that current statistical potentials may have limited value in protein folding algorithms and wherever they are used to provide energy-like quantities.},

abstract = {1. The extracellular patch clamp method, which first allowed the detection of single channel currents in biological membranes, has been further refined to enable higher current resolution, direct membrane patch potential control, and physical isolation of membrane patches. 2. A description of a convenient method for the fabrication of patch recording pipettes is given together with procedures followed to achieve giga-seals i.e. pipette-membrane seals with resistances of 10(9) - 10(11) omega. 3. The basic patch clamp recording circuit, and designs for improved frequency response are described along with the present limitations in recording the currents from single channels. 4. Procedures for preparation and recording from three representative cell types are given. Some properties of single acetylcholine-activated channels in muscle membrane are described to illustrate the improved current and time resolution achieved with giga-seals. 5. A description is given of the various ways that patches of membrane can be physically isolated from cells. This isolation enables the recording of single channel currents with well-defined solutions on both sides of the membrane. Two types of isolated cell-free patch configurations can be formed: an inside-out patch with its cytoplasmic membrane face exposed to the bath solution, and an outside-out patch with its extracellular membrane face exposed to the bath solution. 6. The application of the method for the recording of ionic currents and internal dialysis of small cells is considered. Single channel resolution can be achieved when recording from whole cells, if the cell diameter is small (less than 20 micrometer). 7. The wide range of cell types amenable to giga-seal formation is discussed.},

We combine multiple types of molecular data, including genotypic, expression, transcription factor binding site (TFBS), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data previously generated from a number of yeast experiments, in order to reconstruct causal gene networks. Networks based on different types of data are compared using metrics devised to assess the predictive power of a network. We show that a network reconstructed by integrating genotypic, TFBS and PPI data is the most predictive. This network is used to predict causal regulators responsible for hot spots of gene expression activity in a segregating yeast population. We also show that the network can elucidate the mechanisms by which causal regulators give rise to larger-scale changes in gene expression activity. We then prospectively validate predictions, providing direct experimental evidence that predictive networks can be constructed by integrating multiple, appropriate data types.},

Linguistic [2] and genetic [3-8] studies have located the Romani origins in the Indian subcontinent. However, a genome-wide perspective on Romani origins and population substructure, as well as a detailed reconstruction of their demographic history, has yet to be provided. Our analyses based on genome-wide data from 13 Romani groups collected across Europe suggest that the Romani diaspora constitutes a single initial founder population that originated in north/northwestern India ???1.5 thousand years ago (kya). Our results further indicate that after a rapid migration with moderate gene flow from the Near or Middle East, the European spread of the Romani people was via the Balkans starting ???0.9 kya. The strong population substructure and high levels of homozygosity we found in the European Romani are in line with genetic isolation as well as differential gene flow in time and space with non-Romani Europeans. Overall, our genome-wide study sheds new light on the origins and demographic history of European Romani. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multiple sequence alignment is of central importance to bioinformatics and computational biology. Although a large number of algorithms for computing a multiple sequence alignment have been designed, the efficient computation of highly accurate multiple alignments is still a challenge. RESULTS: We present MSAProbs, a new and practical multiple alignment algorithm for protein sequences. The design of MSAProbs is based on a combination of pair hidden Markov models and partition functions to calculate posterior probabilities. Furthermore, two critical bioinformatics techniques, namely weighted probabilistic consistency transformation and weighted profile-profile alignment, are incorporated to improve alignment accuracy. Assessed using the popular benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark, and OXBENCH, MSAProbs achieves statistically significant accuracy improvements over the existing top performing aligners, including ClustalW, MAFFT, MUSCLE, ProbCons and Probalign. Furthermore, MSAProbs is optimized for multi-core CPUs by employing a multi-threaded design, leading to a competitive execution time compared to other aligners.

Here we identified a role for SETX in controlling the antiviral response. Cells that had undergone depletion of SETX and SETX-deficient cells derived from patients with AOA2 had higher expression of antiviral mediators in response to infection than did wild-type cells. Mechanistically, we propose a model whereby SETX attenuates the activity of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at genes stimulated after a virus is sensed and thus controls the magnitude of the host response to pathogens and the biogenesis of various RNA viruses (e.g., influenza A virus and West Nile virus). Our data indicate a potentially causal link among inborn errors in SETX, susceptibility to infection and the development of neurologic disorders.},

abstract = {In this review we give an overview of the physiological functions of a group of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins, which were discovered, and still referred to, as multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters. Although they indeed play an important role in cancer drug resistance, their major physiological function is to provide general protection against hydrophobic xenobiotics. With a highly conserved structure, membrane topology, and mechanism of action, these essential transporters are preserved throughout all living systems, from bacteria to human. We describe the general structural and mechanistic features of the human MDR-ABC transporters and introduce some of the basic methods that can be applied for the analysis of their expression, function, regulation, and modulation. We treat in detail the biochemistry, cell biology, and physiology of the ABCB1 (MDR1/P-glycoprotein) and the ABCG2 (MXR/BCRP) proteins and describe emerging information related to additional ABCB- and ABCG-type transporters with a potential role in drug and xenobiotic resistance. Throughout this review we demonstrate and emphasize the general network characteristics of the MDR-ABC transporters, functioning at the cellular and physiological tissue barriers. In addition, we suggest that multidrug transporters are essential parts of an innate defense system, the "chemoimmunity" network, which has a number of features reminiscent of classical immunology.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are studied as key regulators of gene expression involved in different diseases. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA genes or target sites (miRNA-related SNPs) have been proved to be associated with human diseases by affecting the miRNA-mediated regulatory function. To systematically analyze miRNA-related SNPs and their effects, we performed a genome-wide scan for SNPs in human pre-miRNAs, miRNA flanking regions, target sites, and designed a pipeline to predict the effects of them on miRNA-target interaction. As a result, we identified 48 SNPs in human miRNA seed regions and thousands of SNPs in 3' untranslated regions with the potential to either disturb or create miRNA-target interactions. Furthermore, we experimentally confirmed seven loss-of-function SNPs and one gain-of-function SNP by luciferase assay. This is the first case of experimental validation of an SNP in an miRNA creating a novel miRNA target binding. All useful data were complied into miRNASNP, a user-friendly free online database (http://www.bioguo.org/miRNASNP/). These data will be a useful resource for studying miRNA function, identifying disease-associated miRNAs, and further personalized medicine.},

To achieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular training set, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training set interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach and show a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a filter approach to feature subset selection. Significant improvement in accuracy is achieved for some datasets for the two families of induction algorithms used: decision trees and Naive-Bayes.},

We modeled the genetic architecture underlying genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for rheumatoid arthritis and developed a new method using polygenic risk-score analyses to infer the total liability-scale variance explained by associated GWAS SNPs. Using this method, we estimated that, together, thousands of SNPs from rheumatoid arthritis GWAS explain an additional 20{\%} of disease risk (excluding known associated loci). We further tested this method on datasets for three additional diseases and obtained comparable estimates for celiac disease (43{\%} excluding the major histocompatibility complex), myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease (48{\%}) and type 2 diabetes (49{\%}). Our results are consistent with simulated genetic models in which hundreds of associated loci harbor common causal variants and a smaller number of loci harbor multiple rare causal variants. These analyses suggest that GWAS will continue to be highly productive for the discovery of additional susceptibility loci for common diseases.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a novel method of deriving a pairwise potential for protein folding. The potential is obtained by an optimization procedure that simultaneously maximizes thermodynamic stability for all proteins in the database. When applied to the representative dataset of proteins and with the energy function taken in pairwise contact approximation, our potential scored somewhat better than existing ones. However, the discrimination of the native structure from decoys is still not strong enough to make the potential useful for ab initio folding. Our results suggest that the problem lies with pairwise amino acid contact approximation and/or simplified presentation of proteins rather than with the derivation of potential. We argue that more detail of protein structure and energetics should be taken into account to achieve energy gaps. The suggested method is general enough to allow us to systematically derive parameters for more sophisticated energy functions. The internal control of validity for the potential derived by our method is convergence to a unique solution upon addition of new proteins to the database. The method is tested on simple model systems where sequences are designed, using the preset "true" potential, to have low energy in a dataset of structures. Our procedure is able to recover the potential with correlation r approximately 91{\%} with the true one and we were able to fold all model structures using the recovered potential. Other statistical knowledge-based approaches were tested using this model and the results indicate that they also can recover the true potential with high degree of accuracy.},

abstract = {CFTR, the ABC protein defective in cystic fibrosis, functions as an anion channel. Once phosphorylated by protein kinase A, a CFTR channel is opened and closed by events at its two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). Formation of a head-to-tail NBD1/NBD2 heterodimer, by ATP binding in two interfacial composite sites between conserved Walker A and B motifs of one NBD and the ABC-specific signature sequence of the other, has been proposed to trigger channel opening. ATP hydrolysis at the only catalytically competent interfacial site is suggested to then destabilize the NBD dimer and prompt channel closure. But this gating mechanism, and how tightly CFTR channel opening and closing are coupled to its catalytic cycle, remains controversial. Here we determine the distributions of open burst durations of individual CFTR channels, and use maximum likelihood to evaluate fits to equilibrium and nonequilibrium mechanisms and estimate the rate constants that govern channel closure. We examine partially and fully phosphorylated wild-type CFTR channels, and two mutant CFTR channels, each bearing a deleterious mutation in one or other composite ATP binding site. We show that the wild-type CFTR channel gating cycle is essentially irreversible and tightly coupled to the ATPase cycle, and that this coupling is completely destroyed by the NBD2 Walker B mutation D1370N but only partially disrupted by the NBD1 Walker A mutation K464A.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The evolution of protein sequences is constrained by complex interactions between amino acid residues. Because harmful substitutions may be compensated for by other substitutions at neighboring sites, residues can coevolve. We describe a Bayesian phylogenetic approach to the detection of coevolving residues in protein families. This method, Bayesian mutational mapping (BMM), assigns mutations to the branches of the evolutionary tree stochastically, and then test statistics are calculated to determine whether a coevolutionary signal exists in the mapping. Posterior predictive P-values provide an estimate of significance, and specificity is maintained by integrating over uncertainty in the estimation of the tree topology, branch lengths and substitution rates. A coevolutionary Markov model for codon substitution is also described, and this model is used as the basis of several test statistics. RESULTS: Results on simulated coevolutionary data indicate that the BMM method can successfully detect nearly all coevolving sites when the model has been correctly specified, and that non-parametric statistics such as mutual information are generally less powerful than parametric statistics. On a dataset of eukaryotic proteins from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) family, interdomain site contacts yield a significantly greater coevolutionary signal than interdomain non-contacts, an indication that the method provides information about interacting sites. Failure to account for the heterogeneity in rates across sites in PGK resulted in a less discriminating test, yielding a marked increase in the number of reported positives at both contact and non-contact sites.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs have emerged as important regulatory genes in a variety of cellular processes and, in recent years, hundreds of such genes have been discovered in animals. In contrast, functional annotations are available only for a very small fraction of these miRNAs, and even in these cases only partially. RESULTS: We developed a general Bayesian method for the inference of miRNA target sites, in which, for each miRNA, we explicitly model the evolution of orthologous target sites in a set of related species. Using this method we predict target sites for all known miRNAs in flies, worms, fish, and mammals. By comparing our predictions in fly with a reference set of experimentally tested miRNA-mRNA interactions we show that our general method performs at least as well as the most accurate methods available to date, including ones specifically tailored for target prediction in fly. An important novel feature of our model is that it explicitly infers the phylogenetic distribution of functional target sites, independently for each miRNA. This allows us to infer species-specific and clade-specific miRNA targeting. We also show that, in long human 3' UTRs, miRNA target sites occur preferentially near the start and near the end of the 3' UTR. To characterize miRNA function beyond the predicted lists of targets we further present a method to infer significant associations between the sets of targets predicted for individual miRNAs and specific biochemical pathways, in particular those of the KEGG pathway database. We show that this approach retrieves several known functional miRNA-mRNA associations, and predicts novel functions for known miRNAs in cell growth and in development. CONCLUSION: We have presented a Bayesian target prediction algorithm without any tunable parameters, that can be applied to sequences from any clade of species. The algorithm automatically infers the phylogenetic distribution of functional sites for each miRNA, and assigns a posterior probability to each putative target site. The results presented here indicate that our general method achieves very good performance in predicting miRNA target sites, providing at the same time insights into the evolution of target sites for individual miRNAs. Moreover, by combining our predictions with pathway analysis, we propose functions of specific miRNAs in nervous system development, inter-cellular communication and cell growth. The complete target site predictions as well as the miRNA/pathway associations are accessible on the ElMMo web server.},

abstract = {Cells employ multiple levels of regulation, including transcriptional and translational regulation, that drive core biological processes and enable cells to respond to genetic and environmental changes. Small-molecule metabolites are one category of critical cellular intermediates that can influence as well as be a target of cellular regulations. Because metabolites represent the direct output of protein-mediated cellular processes, endogenous metabolite concentrations can closely reflect cellular physiological states, especially when integrated with other molecular-profiling data. Here we develop and apply a network reconstruction approach that simultaneously integrates six different types of data: endogenous metabolite concentration, RNA expression, DNA variation, DNA-protein binding, protein-metabolite interaction, and protein-protein interaction data, to construct probabilistic causal networks that elucidate the complexity of cell regulation in a segregating yeast population. Because many of the metabolites are found to be under strong genetic control, we were able to employ a causal regulator detection algorithm to identify causal regulators of the resulting network that elucidated the mechanisms by which variations in their sequence affect gene expression and metabolite concentrations. We examined all four expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) hot spots with colocalized metabolite QTLs, two of which recapitulated known biological processes, while the other two elucidated novel putative biological mechanisms for the eQTL hot spots.},

abstract = {Because of the low overall response rates of 10-47{\%} to targeted cancer therapeutics, there is an increasing need for predictive biomarkers. We aimed to identify genes predicting response to five already approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We tested 45 cancer cell lines for sensitivity to sunitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, sorafenib and gefitinib at the clinically administered doses. A resistance matrix was determined, and gene expression profiles of the subsets of resistant vs. sensitive cell lines were compared. Triplicate gene expression signatures were obtained from the caArray project. Significance analysis of microarrays and rank products were applied for feature selection. Ninety-five genes were also measured by RT-PCR. In case of four sunitinib resistance associated genes, the results were validated in clinical samples by immunohistochemistry. A list of 63 top genes associated with resistance against the five tyrosine kinase inhibitors was identified. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed 45 of 63 genes identified by microarray analysis. Only two genes (ANXA3 and RAB25) were related to sensitivity against more than three inhibitors. The immunohistochemical analysis of sunitinib-treated metastatic renal cell carcinomas confirmed the correlation between RAB17, LGALS8, and EPCAM and overall survival. In summary, we determined predictive biomarkers for five tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and validated sunitinib resistance biomarkers by immunohistochemistry in an independent patient cohort.},

abstract = {Whether somatic mutations contribute functional diversity to brain cells is a long-standing question. Single-neuron genomics enables direct measurement of somatic mutation rates in human brain and promises to answer this question. A recent study (Upton et al., 2015) reported high rates of somatic LINE-1 element (L1) retrotransposition in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex that would have major implications for normal brain function, and suggested that these events preferentially impact genes important for neuronal function. We identify aspects of the single-cell sequencing approach, bioinformatic analysis, and validation methods that led to thousands of artifacts being interpreted as somatic mutation events. Our reanalysis supports a mutation frequency of approximately 0.2 events per cell, which is about fifty-fold lower than reported, confirming that L1 elements mobilize in some human neurons but indicating that L1 mosaicism is not ubiquitous. Through consideration of the challenges identified, we provide a foundation and framework for designing single-cell genomics studies.},

abstract = {Recently developed methods have shown considerable promise in predicting residue-residue contacts in protein 3D structures using evolutionary covariance information. However, these methods require large numbers of evolutionarily related sequences to robustly assess the extent of residue covariation, and the larger the protein family, the more likely that contact information is unnecessary because a reasonable model can be built based on the structure of a homolog. Here we describe a method that integrates sequence coevolution and structural context information using a pseudolikelihood approach, allowing more accurate contact predictions from fewer homologous sequences. We rigorously assess the utility of predicted contacts for protein structure prediction using large and representative sequence and structure databases from recent structure prediction experiments. We find that contact predictions are likely to be accurate when the number of aligned sequences (with sequence redundancy reduced to 90{\%}) is greater than five times the length of the protein, and that accurate predictions are likely to be useful for structure modeling if the aligned sequences are more similar to the protein of interest than to the closest homolog of known structure. These conditions are currently met by 422 of the protein families collected in the Pfam database.},

abstract = {We review the problem of confounding in genetic association studies, which arises principally because of population structure and cryptic relatedness. Many treatments of the problem consider only a simple "island" model of population structure. We take a broader approach, which views population structure and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a single confounder: the unobserved pedigree defining the (often distant) relationships among the study subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and we review methods of defining and estimating kinship coefficients, both pedigree-based and marker-based. In this unified framework we review solutions to the problem of population structure, including family-based study designs, genomic control, structured association, regression control, principal components adjustment and linear mixed models. The last solution makes the most explicit use of the kinships among the study subjects, and has an established role in the analysis of animal and plant breeding studies. Recent computational developments mean that analyses of human genetic association data are beginning to benefit from its powerful tests for association, which protect against population structure and cryptic kinship, as well as intermediate levels of confounding by the pedigree.},

abstract = {Genetic sequence alignment is the basis of many evolutionary and comparative studies, and errors in alignments lead to errors in the interpretation of evolutionary information in genomes. Traditional multiple sequence alignment methods disregard the phylogenetic implications of gap patterns that they create and infer systematically biased alignments with excess deletions and substitutions, too few insertions, and implausible insertion-deletion-event histories. We present a method that prevents these systematic errors by recognizing insertions and deletions as distinct evolutionary events. We show theoretically and practically that this improves the quality of sequence alignments and downstream analyses over a wide range of realistic alignment problems. These results suggest that insertions and sequence turnover are more common than is currently thought and challenge the conventional picture of sequence evolution and mechanisms of functional and structural changes.},

We employ the gradient descent boosting procedure to build an additive tree model and propose a new algorithm to utilize the network structure in fitting small tree weak learners. We illustrate by simulation studies and a real data example that, by making use of the network information, NetBoosting outperforms a few existing methods in terms of accuracy of prediction and variable selection.},

Mapping reads from next-generation sequencers to a given reference genome is an important first step in many sequencing applications. Popular read mappers, such as Bowtie and BWA, are optimized to return top one or a few candidate locations of each read. However, identifying all mapping locations of each read, instead of just one or a few, is also important in some sequencing applications such as ChIP-seq for discovering binding sites in repeat regions, and RNA-seq for transcript abundance estimation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present Hobbes2, a software package designed for fast and accurate alignment of NGS reads and specialized in identifying all mapping locations of each read. Hobbes2 efficiently identifies all mapping locations of reads using a novel technique that utilizes additional prefix q-grams to improve filtering. We extensively compare Hobbes2 with state-of-the-art read mappers, and show that Hobbes2 can be an order of magnitude faster than other read mappers while consuming less memory space and achieving similar accuracy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We propose Hobbes2 to improve the accuracy of read mapping, specialized in identifying all mapping locations of each read.

  abstract      = {From the fertilization of an egg until the death of an individual, somatic cells can accumulate genetic changes, such that cells from different tissues or even within the same tissue differ genetically. The presence of multiple cell clones with distinct genotypes in the same individual is referred to as 'somatic mosaicism'. Many endogenous factors such as mobile elements, DNA polymerase slippage, DNA double-strand break, inefficient DNA repair, unbalanced chromosomal segregation and some exogenous factors such as nicotine and UV exposure can contribute to the generation of somatic mutations, thereby leading to somatic mosaicism. Such changes can potentially affect the epigenetic patterns and levels of gene expression, and ultimately the phenotypes of cells. Although recent studies suggest that somatic mosaicism is widespread during normal development and aging, its implications for heightened disease risks are incompletely understood. Here, I discuss the origins, prevalence and implications of somatic mosaicism in healthy human tissues.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules (20-24 nt), which are believed to participate in repression of gene expression. They play important roles in several biological processes (e.g. cell death and cell growth). Both experimental and computational approaches have been used to determine the function of miRNAs in cellular processes. Most efforts have concentrated on identification of miRNAs and their target genes. However, understanding the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in the gene regulatory network is also essential to the discovery of functions of miRNAs in complex cellular systems. To understand the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in complex cellular systems, we need to identify the functional modules involved in complex interactions between miRNAs and their target genes. RESULTS: We propose a rule-based learning method to identify groups of miRNAs and target genes that are believed to participate cooperatively in the post-transcriptional gene regulation, so-called miRNA regulatory modules (MRMs). Applying our method to human genes and miRNAs, we found 79 MRMs. The MRMs are produced from multiple information sources, including miRNA-target binding information, gene expression and miRNA expression profiles. Analysis of two first MRMs shows that these MRMs consist of highly-related miRNAs and their target genes with respect to biological processes. CONCLUSION: The MRMs found by our method have high correlation in expression patterns of miRNAs as well as mRNAs. The mRNAs included in the same module shared similar biological functions, indicating the ability of our method to detect functionality-related genes. Moreover, review of the literature reveals that miRNAs in a module are involved in several types of human cancer.},

@article{Reyes-Herrera2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computational methods for microRNA target prediction are a fundamental step to understand the miRNA role in gene regulation, a key process in molecular biology. In this paper we present miREE, a novel microRNA target prediction tool. miREE is an ensemble of two parts entailing complementary but integrated roles in the prediction. The Ab-Initio module leverages upon a genetic algorithmic approach to generate a set of candidate sites on the basis of their microRNA-mRNA duplex stability properties. Then, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning module evaluates the impact of microRNA recognition elements on the target gene. As a result the prediction takes into account information regarding both miRNA-target structural stability and accessibility.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The proposed method significantly improves the state-of-the-art prediction tools in terms of accuracy with a better balance between specificity and sensitivity, as demonstrated by the experiments conducted on several large datasets across different species. miREE achieves this result by tackling two of the main challenges of current prediction tools: (1) The reduced number of false positives for the Ab-Initio part thanks to the integration of a machine learning module (2) the specificity of the machine learning part, obtained through an innovative technique for rich and representative negative records generation. The validation was conducted on experimental datasets where the miRNA:mRNA interactions had been obtained through (1) direct validation where even the binding site is provided, or through (2) indirect validation, based on gene expression variations obtained from high-throughput experiments where the specific interaction is not validated in detail and consequently the specific binding site is not provided.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The coupling of two parts: a sensitive Ab-Initio module and a selective machine learning part capable of recognizing the false positives, leads to an improved balance between sensitivity and specificity. miREE obtains a reasonable trade-off between filtering false positives and identifying targets. miREE tool is available online at http://didattica-online.polito.it/eda/miREE/},

In cancer, the disruption of cellular mechanisms that normally suppress TE activity may facilitate mutagenic retrotranspositions. We performed single-nucleotide resolution analysis of TE insertions in 43 high-coverage whole-genome sequencing data sets from five cancer types. We identified 194 high-confidence somatic TE insertions, as well as thousands of polymorphic TE insertions in matched normal genomes. Somatic insertions were present in epithelial tumors but not in blood or brain cancers. Somatic L1 insertions tend to occur in genes that are commonly mutated in cancer, disrupt the expression of the target genes, and are biased toward regions of cancer-specific DNA hypomethylation, highlighting their potential impact in tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

@article{Dutheil:2010fk,
abstract = {It has long been accepted that the structural constraints stemming from the 3D structure of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) lead to coevolution through compensating mutations between interacting sites. State-of-the-art methods for detecting coevolving sites, however, while reaching high levels of specificity and sensitivity for Watson-Crick (WC) pairs of the helices defining the secondary structure, only scarcely reveal tertiary interactions occurring at the level of the 3D structure. In order to understand the relative failure of coevolutionary methods to detect such interactions, we analyze 2,682 interacting sites derived from high-resolution structures, which include a comprehensive data set of rRNA sequences from Archaea and Bacteria. We report a striking difference in the amount of coevolution between WC and non-WC pairs. In order to understand this pattern, we derive fitness landscapes from the geometry of base pairing interactions and construct neutral networks of substitutions for each type of interaction. These networks show that coevolution is a property of WC pairs because, unlike non-WC pairs, their landscapes exhibit fitness valleys, a single mutation in a WC pair resulting in a fitness drop. Second, we used the inferred neutral networks to estimate the level of constraint acting on each type of base pair and show that it correlates negatively with the observed rate of substitutions for all non-WC pairs. WC pairs appear as outliers, fixing more substitutions than expected according to their level of constraint. We here propose that the rate of substitution in WC pairs is due to coevolution resulting from constraints acting at intermediate levels of organization, namely the one of the helical stem with its forming WC pairs. In agreement with this hypothesis, we report a significant excess of intrahelical, inter-WC pairs coevolution compared with interhelices pairs. Altogether, these results show that detailed biochemical knowledge is required and has to be incorporated into evolutionary reasoning in order to understand the fine patterns of variation at the molecular level. They also demonstrate that coevolutionary analysis provides almost exclusively 2D information and only little 3D signal.},

The FASTA program is a more sensitive derivative of the FASTP program, which can be used to search protein or DNA sequence data bases and can compare a protein sequence to a DNA sequence data base by translating the DNA data base as it is searched. FASTA includes an additional step in the calculation of the initial pairwise similarity score that allows multiple regions of similarity to be joined to increase the score of related sequences. The RDF2 program can be used to evaluate the significance of similarity scores using a shuffling method that preserves local sequence composition. The LFASTA program can display all the regions of local similarity between two sequences with scores greater than a threshold, using the same scoring parameters and a similar alignment algorithm; these local similarities can be displayed as a "graphic matrix" plot or as individual alignments. In addition, these programs have been generalized to allow comparison of DNA or protein sequences based on a variety of alternative scoring matrices.},

abstract = {Large-scale association studies are being undertaken with the hope of uncovering the genetic determinants of complex disease. We describe a computationally efficient method for inferring genealogies from population genotype data and show how these genealogies can be used to fine map disease loci and interpret association signals. These genealogies take the form of the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). The ARG defines a genealogical tree for each locus, and, as one moves along the chromosome, the topologies of consecutive trees shift according to the impact of historical recom-bination events. There are two stages to our analysis. First, we infer plausible ARGs, using a heuristic algorithm, which can handle unphased and missing data and is fast enough to be applied to large-scale studies. Second, we test the genealogical tree at each locus for a clustering of the disease cases beneath a branch, suggesting that a causative mutation occurred on that branch. Since the true ARG is unknown, we average this analysis over an ensemble of inferred ARGs. We have characterized the performance of our method across a wide range of simulated disease models. Compared with simpler tests, our method gives increased accuracy in positioning untyped causative loci and can also be used to estimate the frequencies of untyped causative alleles. We have applied our method to Ueda et al.'s association study of CTLA4 and Graves disease, showing how it can be used to dissect the association signal, giving potentially interesting results of allelic heterogeneity and interaction. Similar approaches analyzing an ensemble of ARGs inferred using our method may be applicable to many other problems of inference from population genotype data.},

Unlike germline and cancer SNVs, which are often caused by errors in DNA replication, neuronal mutations appear to reflect damage during active transcription.

abstract = {Schizophrenia is a heritable brain illness with unknown pathogenic mechanisms. Schizophrenia's strongest genetic association at a population level involves variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, but the genes and molecular mechanisms accounting for this have been challenging to identify. Here we show that this association arises in part from many structurally diverse alleles of the complement component 4 (C4) genes. We found that these alleles generated widely varying levels of C4A and C4B expression in the brain, with each common C4 allele associating with schizophrenia in proportion to its tendency to generate greater expression of C4A. Human C4 protein localized to neuronal synapses, dendrites, axons, and cell bodies. In mice, C4 mediated synapse elimination during postnatal development. These results implicate excessive complement activity in the development of schizophrenia and may help explain the reduced numbers of synapses in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Nearly all of the genetic material among cells within an organism is identical. However, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), small insertions/deletions (indels), copy-number variants (CNVs), and other structural variants (SVs) continually accumulate as cells divide during development. This process results in an organism composed of countless cells, each with its own unique personal genome. Thus, every human is undoubtedly mosaic. Mosaic mutations can go unnoticed, underlie genetic disease or normal human variation, and may be transmitted to the next generation as constitutional variants. We review the influence of the developmental timing of mutations, the mechanisms by which they arise, methods for detecting mosaic variants, and the risk of passing these mutations on to the next generation.},

abstract = {miRNAs are small RNA molecules (′22 nt) that interact with their target mRNAs inhibiting translation or/and cleavaging the target mRNA. This interaction is guided by sequence complentarity and results in the reduction of mRNA and/or protein levels. miRNAs are involved in key biological processes and different diseases. Therefore, deciphering miRNA targets is crucial for diagnostics and therapeutics. However, miRNA regulatory mechanisms are complex and there is still no high-throughput and low-cost miRNA target screening technique. In recent years, several computational methods based on sequence complementarity of the miRNA and the mRNAs have been developed. However, the predicted interactions using these computational methods are inconsistent and the expected false positive rates are still large. Recently, it has been proposed to use the expression values of miRNAs and mRNAs (and/or proteins) to refine the results of sequence-based putative targets for a particular experiment. These methods have shown to be effective identifying the most prominent interactions from the databases of putative targets. Here, we review these methods that combine both expression and sequence-based putative targets to predict miRNA targets.},

abstract = {Gene expression data, in conjunction with information on genetic variants, have enabled studies to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) or polymorphic locations in the genome that are associated with expression levels. Moreover, recent technological developments and cost decreases have further enabled studies to collect expression data in multiple tissues. One advantage of multiple tissue datasets is that studies can combine results from different tissues to identify eQTLs more accurately than examining each tissue separately. The idea of aggregating results of multiple tissues is closely related to the idea of meta-analysis which aggregates results of multiple genome-wide association studies to improve the power to detect associations. In principle, meta-analysis methods can be used to combine results from multiple tissues. However, eQTLs may have effects in only a single tissue, in all tissues, or in a subset of tissues with possibly different effect sizes. This heterogeneity in terms of effects across multiple tissues presents a key challenge to detect eQTLs. In this paper, we develop a framework that leverages two popular meta-analysis methods that address effect size heterogeneity to detect eQTLs across multiple tissues. We show by using simulations and multiple tissue data from mouse that our approach detects many eQTLs undetected by traditional eQTL methods. Additionally, our method provides an interpretation framework that accurately predicts whether an eQTL has an effect in a particular tissue.},

  abstract      = {Residue-residue interactions define the protein fold, and their dynamic interplay mediates conformational rearrangements between global states, such as the outward- or inward-facing conformations of transporters. These physical interactions constrain sequence evolution by coupling the pattern of amino acid substitution at interacting positions (coevolution). Thus, identification of coevolving positions can provide structural and mechanistic insights at the resolution of single residues.

Here we identified coevolving positions in the OAD and DPL families of the ABC superfamily. These families harbor exporters involved in multidrug resistance like MDR1/Pgp (DPL) and MRPs (OAD), as well as the CFTR chloride channel (OAD) linked to cystic fibrosis. We generated multiple sequence alignments separately for OADs and DPLs, and analyzed them with three different statistical methods.

The three methods yielded somewhat different results likely due to their limited accuracy and differences in their assumptions about mechanisms of coevolution. Nonetheless, the results are validated by three lines of structural evidence, all supporting the hypothesis that direct physical interactions play a major role in coevolution. First, coevolution statistics were significantly linked to spatial distance in a 3D structural model. Second, the methods agreed better if only contacting positions were considered. Third, coevolving pairs were separated in sequences according to the periodicity of alpha helices and beta sheets. We present sets of coevolving pairs that link different transmembrane helices, or that link the coupling helices to the ATP-binding cassettes. Our findings provide specific, testable hypotheses for mutational and crosslinking studies on the detailed transport mechanisms of clinically relevant ABC proteins such as those underlying cystic fibrosis and multidrug resistance.},

abstract = {Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An over-dispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of over-dispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

Since dysfunctional regulation would be manifested as the decoupling of expression correlation, disease similarity (DS) in terms of dysfunctional regulation mechanism (DRM) could be estimated by using a differential coexpression based approach, which is described in a companion paper. Due to the lack of tools for estimating DS from the viewpoint of DRM in public domain, we implemented an R package 'DSviaDRM' to identify significant DS via DRM based on transcriptomic data. DSviaDRM contains five easy-to-use functions, DCEA, DCpathway, DS, comDCGL and comDCGLplot, for identifying disease relationships and showing common differential regulation information shared by similar diseases.

abstract = {P-type ATPase pumps generate concentration gradients of cations across membranes in nearly all cells. They provide a polar transmembrane pathway, to which access is strictly controlled by coupled gates that are constrained to open alternately, thereby enabling thermodynamically uphill ion transport (for example, see ref. 1). Here we examine the ion pathway through the Na+,K+-ATPase, a representative P-type pump, after uncoupling its extra- and intracellular gates with the marine toxin palytoxin. We use small hydrophilic thiol-specific reagents as extracellular probes and we monitor their reactions, and the consequences, with cysteine residues introduced along the anticipated cation pathway through the pump. The distinct effects of differently charged reagents indicate that a wide outer vestibule penetrates deep into the Na+,K+-ATPase, where the pathway narrows and leads to a charge-selectivity filter. Acidic residues in this region, which are conserved to coordinate pumped ions, allow the approach of cations but exclude anions. Reversing the charge at just one of those positions converts the pathway from cation selective to anion selective. Close structural homology among the catalytic subunits of Ca2+-, Na+,K+- and H+,K+-ATPases argues that their extracytosolic cation exchange pathways all share these physical characteristics.},

abstract = {Communication between distant sites often defines the biological role of a protein: amino acid long-range interactions are as important in binding specificity, allosteric regulation and conformational change as residues directly contacting the substrate. The maintaining of functional and structural coupling of long-range interacting residues requires coevolution of these residues. Networks of interaction between coevolved residues can be reconstructed, and from the networks, one can possibly derive insights into functional mechanisms for the protein family. We propose a combinatorial method for mapping conserved networks of amino acid interactions in a protein which is based on the analysis of a set of aligned sequences, the associated distance tree and the combinatorics of its subtrees. The degree of coevolution of all pairs of coevolved residues is identified numerically, and networks are reconstructed with a dedicated clustering algorithm. The method drops the constraints on high sequence divergence limiting the range of applicability of the statistical approaches previously proposed. We apply the method to four protein families where we show an accurate detection of functional networks and the possibility to treat sets of protein sequences of variable divergence.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that species sorting, that is, the selection by local environmental conditions is important for the composition and assembly of bacterial communities. On the other hand, there are other studies that could show that bacterial communities are neutrally assembled. In this study, we implemented a microcosm experiment with the aim to determine, at the same time, the importance of species sorting and neutral processes for bacterial community assembly during the colonisation of new, that is, sterile, habitats, by atmospheric bacteria. For this we used outdoor microcosms, which contained sterile medium from three different rock pools representing different environmental conditions, which were seeded by rainwater bacteria. We found some evidence for neutral assembly processes, as almost every 4th taxon growing in the microcosms was also detectable in the rainwater sample irrespective of the medium. Most of these taxa belonged to widespread families with opportunistic growth strategies, such as the Pseudomonadaceae and Comamonadaceae, indicating that neutrally assembled taxa may primarily be generalists. On the other hand, we also found evidence for species sorting, as one out of three media selected a differently composed bacterial community. Species sorting effects were relatively weak and established themselves via differences in relative abundance of generalists among the different media, as well as media-specific occurrences of a few specific taxa. In summary, our results suggest that neutral and species sorting processes interact during the assembly of bacterial communities and that their importance may differ depending on how many generalists and specialists are present in a community.},

In the present study, we have developed simplified models of the wild-type $\alpha$HL pore and various mutants in order to study the translocation dynamics of single-stranded DNA under the influence of an applied electric field. The model nanopores reflect the experimentally measured conductance values in planar lipid bilayers. We show that interactions between rings of cationic amino acids and DNA backbone phosphates result in metastable tethering of nucleic acid molecules within the pore, leading us to propose a "binding and sliding" mechanism for translocation. We also observe folding of DNA into nonlinear conformational intermediates during passage through the confined nanopore environment. Despite adopting nonlinear conformations, the DNA hexamer always exits the pore in the same orientation as it enters (3' to 5') in our simulations. The observations from our simulations help to rationalize experimentally determined trends in residual current and translocation efficiency for $\alpha$HL and its mutants.},

abstract = {To understand how miRNAs contribute to the molecular phenotype of adipose tissues and related traits, we performed global miRNA expression profiling in subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue of 70 human subjects and characterised which miRNAs were differentially expressed between these tissues. We found that 12{\%} of the miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed between abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue (FDR adjusted p{\textless}0.05) in the primary study, of which 59 replicated in a follow-up study of 40 additional subjects. Further, 14 miRNAs were found to be associated with metabolic syndrome case-control status in abdominal tissue and three of these replicated (primary study: FDR adjusted p{\textless}0.05, replication: p{\textless}0.05 and directionally consistent effect). Genome-wide genotyping was performed in the 70 subjects to enable miRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Candidate miRNA eQTLs were followed-up in the additional 40 subjects and six significant, independent cis-located miRNA eQTLs (primary study: p{\textless}0.001; replication: p{\textless}0.05 and directionally consistent effect) were identified. Finally, global mRNA expression profiling was performed in both tissues to enable association analysis between miRNA and target mRNA expression levels. We find 22{\%} miRNAs in abdominal and 9{\%} miRNAs in gluteal adipose tissue with expression levels significantly associated with the expression of corresponding target mRNAs (FDR adjusted p{\textless}0.05). Taken together, our results indicate a clear difference in the miRNA molecular phenotypic profile of abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue, that the expressions of some miRNAs are influenced by cis-located genetic variants and that miRNAs are associated with expression levels of their predicted mRNA targets.},

abstract = {Genome-wide profiling of histone modifications can provide systematic insight into the regulatory elements and programs engaged in a given cell type. However, conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) does not capture quantitative information on histone modification levels, requires large amounts of starting material, and involves tedious processing of each individual sample. Here, we address these limitations with a technology that leverages DNA barcoding to profile chromatin quantitatively and in multiplexed format. We concurrently map relative levels of multiple histone modifications across multiple samples, each comprising as few as a thousand cells. We demonstrate the technology by monitoring dynamic changes following inhibition of p300, EZH2, or KDM5, by linking altered epigenetic landscapes to chromatin regulator mutations, and by mapping active and repressive marks in purified human hematopoietic stem cells. Hence, this technology enables quantitative studies of chromatin state dynamics across rare cell types, genotypes, environmental conditions, and drug treatments. van Galen et al. introduce an approach for multiplexed ChIP-seq on small cell numbers. The approach allows quantitative comparisons of global and locus-specific histone modification levels. The technology is demonstrated by mapping hematopoietic stem cell chromatin landscapes and quantifying changes in leukemia cells treated with epigenetic inhibitors.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most methods for estimating differential expression from RNA-seq are based on statistics that compare normalized read counts between treatment classes. Unfortunately, reads are in general too short to be mapped unambiguously to features of interest, such as genes, isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms. There are methods for estimating expression levels that account for this source of ambiguity. However, the uncertainty is not generally accounted for in downstream analysis of gene expression experiments. Moreover, at the individual transcript level, it can sometimes be too large to allow useful comparisons between treatment groups. RESULTS: In this article we make two proposals that improve the power, specificity and versatility of expression analysis using RNA-seq data. First, we present a Bayesian method for model selection that accounts for read mapping ambiguities using random effects. This polytomous model selection approach can be used to identify many interesting patterns of gene expression and is not confined to detecting differential expression between two groups. For illustration, we use our method to detect imprinting, different types of regulatory divergence in cis and in trans and differential isoform usage, but many other applications are possible. Second, we present a novel collapsing algorithm for grouping transcripts into inferential units that exploits the posterior correlation between transcript expression levels. The aggregate expression levels of these units can be estimated with useful levels of uncertainty. Our algorithm can improve the precision of expression estimates when uncertainty is large with only a small reduction in biological resolution. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: We have implemented our software in the mmdiff and mmcollapse multithreaded C++ programs as part of the open-source MMSEQ package, available on https://github.com/eturro/mmseq.},

abstract = {The study of molecular evolution at the level of protein-coding genes often entails comparing large datasets of sequences to infer their evolutionary relationships. Despite the importance of a protein's structure and conformational dynamics to its function and thus its fitness, common phylogenetic methods embody minimal biophysical knowledge of proteins. To underscore the biophysical constraints on natural selection, we survey effects of protein mutations, highlighting the physical basis for marginal stability of natural globular proteins and how requirement for kinetic stability and avoidance of misfolding and misinteractions might have affected protein evolution. The biophysical underpinnings of these effects have been addressed by models with an explicit coarse-grained spatial representation of the polypeptide chain. Sequence-structure mappings based on such models are powerful conceptual tools that rationalize mutational robustness, evolvability, epistasis, promiscuous function performed by 'hidden' conformational states, resolution of adaptive conflicts and conformational switches in the evolution from one protein fold to another. Recently, protein biophysics has been applied to derive more accurate evolutionary accounts of sequence data. Methods have also been developed to exploit sequence-based evolutionary information to predict biophysical behaviours of proteins. The success of these approaches demonstrates a deep synergy between the fields of protein biophysics and protein evolution.},

In particular, polymorphisms have been extensively used to infer the fitness effects of mutations and their dynamics of fixation. However, the role and contribution of molecular biophysics to these observations remain unclear. Here, we couple robust findings from protein biophysics, enzymatic flux theory, the selection against the cytotoxic effects of protein misfolding, and explicit population dynamics simulations in the polyclonal regime. First, we recapitulate results on the dynamics of clonal interference and on the shape of the DFE, thus providing them with a molecular and mechanistic foundation. Second, we predict that if evolution is indeed under the dynamic equilibrium of mutation-selection balance, the fraction of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations is almost equal among single-nucleotide polymorphisms segregating at high allele frequencies. This prediction is proven true for polymorphisms in the human coding region. Overall, our results show how selection for protein folding stability predominantly shapes the patterns of polymorphisms in coding regions.},

We developed a supervised learning framework for integrating molecular profiles with regulatory sequence information to reveal regulatory programs in cancer, including miRNA-mediated regulation. We applied our approach to 320 glioblastoma profiles and identified key miRNAs and transcription factors as common or subtype-specific drivers of expression changes. We confirmed that predicted gene expression signatures for proneural subtype regulators were consistent with in vivo expression changes in a PDGF-driven mouse model. We tested two predicted proneural drivers, miR-124 and miR-132, both underexpressed in proneural tumors, by overexpression in neurospheres and observed a partial reversal of corresponding tumor expression changes. Computationally dissecting the role of miRNAs in cancer may ultimately lead to small RNA therapeutics tailored to subtype or individual.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identification of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in tumour genomes is a necessary step in defining the mutational landscapes of cancers. Experimental designs for genome-wide ascertainment of somatic mutations now routinely include next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumour DNA and matched constitutional DNA from the same individual. This allows investigators to control for germline polymorphisms and distinguish somatic mutations that are unique to the tumour, thus reducing the burden of labour-intensive and expensive downstream experiments needed to verify initial predictions. In order to make full use of such paired datasets, computational tools for simultaneous analysis of tumour-normal paired sequence data are required, but are currently under-developed and under-represented in the bioinformatics literature. RESULTS: In this contribution, we introduce two novel probabilistic graphical models called JointSNVMix1 and JointSNVMix2 for jointly analysing paired tumour-normal digital allelic count data from NGS experiments. In contrast to independent analysis of the tumour and normal data, our method allows statistical strength to be borrowed across the samples and therefore amplifies the statistical power to identify and distinguish both germline and somatic events in a unified probabilistic framework.

abstract = {Sequencing of gene-coding regions (the exome) is increasingly used for studying human disease, for which copy-number variants (CNVs) are a critical genetic component. However, detecting copy number from exome sequencing is challenging because of the noncontiguous nature of the captured exons. This is compounded by the complex relationship between read depth and copy number; this results from biases in targeted genomic hybridization, sequence factors such as GC content, and batching of samples during collection and sequencing. We present a statistical tool (exome hidden Markov model [XHMM]) that uses principal-component analysis (PCA) to normalize exome read depth and a hidden Markov model (HMM) to discover exon-resolution CNV and genotype variation across samples. We evaluate performance on 90 schizophrenia trios and 1,017 case-control samples. XHMM detects a median of two rare ({\textless}1{\%}) CNVs per individual (one deletion and one duplication) and has 79{\%} sensitivity to similarly rare CNVs overlapping three or more exons discovered with microarrays. With sensitivity similar to state-of-the-art methods, XHMM achieves higher specificity by assigning quality metrics to the CNV calls to filter out bad ones, as well as to statistically genotype the discovered CNV in all individuals, yielding a trio call set with Mendelian-inheritance properties highly consistent with expectation. We also show that XHMM breakpoint quality scores enable researchers to explicitly search for novel classes of structural variation. For example, we apply XHMM to extract those CNVs that are highly likely to disrupt (delete or duplicate) only a portion of a gene. ?? 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The task of engineering a protein to perform a target biological function is known as protein design. A commonly used paradigm casts this functional design problem as a structural one, assuming a fixed backbone. In probabilistic protein design, positional amino acid probabilities are used to create a random library of sequences to be simultaneously screened for biological activity. Clearly, certain choices of probability distributions will be more successful in yielding functional sequences. However, since the number of sequences is exponential in protein length, computational optimization of the distribution is difficult.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this paper, we develop a computational framework for probabilistic protein design following the structural paradigm. We formulate the distribution of sequences for a structure using the Boltzmann distribution over their free energies. The corresponding probabilistic graphical model is constructed, and we apply belief propagation (BP) to calculate marginal amino acid probabilities. We test this method on a large structural dataset and demonstrate the superiority of BP over previous methods. Nevertheless, since the results obtained by BP are far from optimal, we thoroughly assess the paradigm using high-quality experimental data. We demonstrate that, for small scale sub-problems, BP attains identical results to those produced by exact inference on the paradigmatic model. However, quantitative analysis shows that the distributions predicted significantly differ from the experimental data. These findings, along with the excellent performance we observed using BP on the smaller problems, suggest potential shortcomings of the paradigm. We conclude with a discussion of how it may be improved in the future.},

Our approach extends the static concept of fitness landscapes to dynamic fitness seascapes. It shows that adaptation requires a surplus of beneficial substitutions over deleterious ones.

We have reassessed the energetic coupling of these residues by double mutant cycles together with ligand binding and stability experiments and found that coupling is not a special property of the coevolved network of residues in PDZ domains. The observed coupling for ligand binding is better explained by a distance relationship, where residues close in space are more likely to couple than distal residues. Our study demonstrates that statistical coupling from sequence analysis is not necessarily a reporter of energetic coupling and allostery.},

On the other hand, third-generation sequencing, which yields much longer reads, has current limitations of lower raw accuracy and throughput. Here, we combine second-generation sequencing and third-generation sequencing with a custom-designed method for isoform identification and quantification to generate a high-confidence isoform dataset for human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We report 8,084 RefSeq-annotated isoforms detected as full-length and an additional 5,459 isoforms predicted through statistical inference. Over one-third of these are novel isoforms, including 273 RNAs from gene loci that have not previously been identified. Further characterization of the novel loci indicates that a subset is expressed in pluripotent cells but not in diverse fetal and adult tissues; moreover, their reduced expression perturbs the network of pluripotency-associated genes. Results suggest that gene identification, even in well-characterized human cell lines and tissues, is likely far from complete.},

abstract = {Naturally evolving proteins gradually accumulate mutations while continuing to fold to stable structures. This process of neutral evolution is an important mode of genetic change and forms the basis for the molecular clock. We present a mathematical theory that predicts the number of accumulated mutations, the index of dispersion, and the distribution of stabilities in an evolving protein population from knowledge of the stability effects (delta deltaG values) for single mutations. Our theory quantitatively describes how neutral evolution leads to marginally stable proteins and provides formulas for calculating how fluctuations in stability can overdisperse the molecular clock. It also shows that the structural influences on the rate of sequence evolution observed in earlier simulations can be calculated using just the single-mutation delta deltaG values. We consider both the case when the product of the population size and mutation rate is small and the case when this product is large, and show that in the latter case the proteins evolve excess mutational robustness that is manifested by extra stability and an increase in the rate of sequence evolution. All our theoretical predictions are confirmed by simulations with lattice proteins. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding how protein biophysics shapes the process of evolution.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plays a central role in transepithelial ion transport by acting as a tightly regulated apical chloride channel. Regulation is achieved by the concerted action of ATP at conserved nucleotide binding folds and serine phosphorylation at multiple sites by protein kinases A (PKA) and C (PKC). A previous investigation concluded that activation by PKA is critically dependent on phosphorylation at four of the nine predicted PKA sites in the R domain (S660A, S737A, S795A, S813A), because a "Quad" mutant lacking these sites could not be activated. We show in the present work that not only can this mutant be phosphorylated and activated, but a mutant in which all 10 predicted PKA sites have been altered still retains significant PKA-activated function. Potentiation of the PKA response by PKC is also preserved in this mutant. Thus CFTR may be regulated by cryptic PKA sites which also mediate interactions between different kinases. Such hierarchical phosphorylation of CFTR by obvious and cryptic PKA sites could provide a metered response to secretagogues.},

abstract = {We present a prototype of a new approach to the folding problem of polypeptide chains. This approach is based on the analysis of known protein structures. It derives the energy potentials for the atomic interactions of all amino acid residue pairs as a function of the distance between the involved atoms. These potentials are then used to calculate the energies of all conformations that exist in the data base with respect to a given sequence. Then, by using only the most stable conformations, clusters of the most probable conformations for the given sequence are obtained. To discuss the results properly we introduce a new classification of segments based on their conformational stability. Special care is taken to allow for sparse data sets. The use of the method is demonstrated in the discussion of the identical oligopeptide sequences found in different conformations in unrelated proteins. VNTFV, for example, adopts a beta-strand in ribonuclease but it is found in an alpha-helical conformation in erythrocruorin. In the case of VNTFV the ensemble obtained consists of a single cluster of beta-strand conformations, indicating that this may be the preferred conformation for the pentapeptide. When the flanking residues are included in the calculation the hepapeptide P-VNTFV-H (ribonuclease) again yields an ensemble of beta-strands. However, in the ensemble of D-VNTFV-A (erythrocruorin) the major cluster is of alpha-helical type. In the present study we concentrate on the local aspects of protein conformations. However, the theory presented is quite general and not restricted to oligopeptides. We indicate extensions of the approach to the calculation of global conformations of proteins as well as conceivable applications to a number of molecular systems.},

abstract = {The primary secretion formed in various exocrine glands has a [K+] 2-5 times that of plasma. In this study we measured the transepithelial flux of 36Cl-, 22Na+ and 42K+ across the frog skin and applied the single-channel patch-clamp technique to the apical membrane of frog skin gland acini to investigate the pathway taken by K+ secreted by the glands. Transepithelial K+ secretion was active and was driven by a larger force than the secretion of Na+. When driving Na+ through the epithelium by clamping the transepithelial potential to 100 mV (apical solution reference), blockers of cellular secretion (apical 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoate or basolateral quinine or furosemide) decreased K+ secretion but left Na+ secretion unaffected. We conclude that K+ follows a transcellular pathway across the epithelium. Patch-clamp analysis of the apical membrane of microdissected gland acini revealed a population of voltage- and calcium-activated K+ channels of the maxi K+ type. In cell-attached patches these channels were activated by membrane potential depolarisation or exposure to prostaglandin E2 and had a permeability of 3.6 +/- 0.3 x 10(-13) cm3 s-1, giving a calculated conductance of 170 pS with 125 mM K+ on both sides of the membrane. In inside-out patches the channels were activated by increasing intracellular [Ca2+] from 10(-7) to 10(-6) M and were blocked by Ba2+ added to the cytoplasmic side. Exposure of inside-out patches containing the maxi K+ channel to ATP on the inside activated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channels, confirming that both channels are co-localised to the apical membrane. We interpret these findings in terms of a model where transepithelial NaCl secretion can be supported in part by an apical K+ conductance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Somatically-acquired translocations may serve as important markers for assessing the cause and nature of diseases like cancer. Algorithms to locate translocations may use next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform data. However, paired-end strategies do not accurately predict precise translocation breakpoints, and "split-read" methods may lose sensitivity if a translocation boundary is not captured by many sequenced reads. To address these challenges, we have developed "Bellerophon", a method that uses discordant read pairs to identify potential translocations, and subsequently uses "soft-clipped" reads to predict the location of the precise breakpoints. Furthermore, for each chimeric breakpoint, our method attempts to classify it as a participant in an unbalanced translocation, balanced translocation, or interchromosomal insertion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We compared Bellerophon to four previously published algorithms for detecting structural variation (SV). Using two simulated datasets and two prostate cancer datasets, Bellerophon had overall better performance than the other methods. Furthermore, our method accurately predicted the presence of the interchromosomal insertions placed in our simulated dataset, which is an ability that the other SV prediction programs lack.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The combined use of paired reads and soft-clipped reads allows Bellerophon to detect interchromosomal breakpoints with high sensitivity, while also mitigating losses in specificity. This trend is seen across all datasets examined. Because it does not perform assembly on soft-clipped subreads, Bellerophon may be limited in experiments where sequence read lengths are short.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: The program can be downloaded from http://cbc.case.edu/Bellerophon.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of an absorbing leaky epithelium is developed for analysis of solute coupled water transport. The non-charged driving solute diffuses into cells and is pumped from cells into the lateral intercellular space (lis). All membranes contain water channels with the solute passing those of tight junction and interspace basement membrane by convection-diffusion. With solute permeability of paracellular pathway large relative to paracellular water flow, the paracellular flux ratio of the solute (influx/outflux) is small (2-4) in agreement with experiments. The virtual solute concentration of fluid emerging from lis is then significantly larger than the concentration in lis. Thus, in absence of external driving forces the model generates isotonic transport provided a component of the solute flux emerging downstream lis is taken up by cells through the serosal membrane and pumped back into lis, i.e., the solute would have to be recirculated. With input variables from toad intestine (Nedergaard, S., E.H. Larsen, and H.H. Ussing, J. Membr. Biol. 168:241-251), computations predict that 60-80{\%} of the pumped flux stems from serosal bath in agreement with the experimental estimate of the recirculation flux. Robust solutions are obtained with realistic concentrations and pressures of lis, and with the following features. Rate of fluid absorption is governed by the solute permeability of mucosal membrane. Maximum fluid flow is governed by density of pumps on lis-membranes. Energetic efficiency increases with hydraulic conductance of the pathway carrying water from mucosal solution into lis. Uphill water transport is accomplished, but with high hydraulic conductance of cell membranes strength of transport is obscured by water flow through cells. Anomalous solvent drag occurs when back flux of water through cells exceeds inward water flux between cells. Molecules moving along the paracellular pathway are driven by a translateral flow of water, i.e., the model generates pseudo-solvent drag. The associated flux-ratio equation is derived.},

Moreover, all the sequence, structure and machine learning based algorithms are unable to distribute the true positive predictions preferentially at the top of the ranked list; hence the algorithms become unreliable to the biologists. In addition, these algorithms fail to obtain considerable combination of precision and recall for the target transcripts that are translationally repressed at protein level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: In the proposed article, we introduce an efficient miRNA-target prediction system MultiMiTar, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier integrated with a multiobjective metaheuristic based feature selection technique. The robust performance of the proposed method is mainly the result of using high quality negative examples and selection of biologically relevant miRNA-targeting site context specific features. The features are selected by using a novel feature selection technique AMOSA-SVM, that integrates the multi objective optimization technique Archived Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (AMOSA) and SVM.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MultiMiTar is found to achieve much higher Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.583 and average class-wise accuracy (ACA) of 0.8 compared to the others target prediction methods for a completely independent test data set. The obtained MCC and ACA values of these algorithms range from -0.269 to 0.155 and 0.321 to 0.582, respectively. Moreover, it shows a more balanced result in terms of precision and sensitivity (recall) for the translationally repressed data set as compared to all the other existing methods. An important aspect is that the true positive predictions are distributed preferentially at the top of the ranked list that makes MultiMiTar reliable for the biologists.

Channels in stimulated cells reversed at 0 mV applied potential, whereas channels in unstimulated cells reversed at depolarized potentials (28.1 +/- 6.7 mV), indicating that Cl- was above electrochemical equilibrium in unstimulated, but not in stimulated, cells. In excised inside-out patches with 25 mM Cl- on the inside, activity of small (8-pS) linear Cl--selective channels was dependent upon bath ATP (1.5 mM) and increased upon exposure to cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The channels displayed a single substate, located just below 2/3 of the full channel amplitude. Halide selectivity was identified as PBr {\textgreater} PI {\textgreater} PCl from the Goldman equation; however, the conductance sequence when either halide was permeating the channel was GCl {\textgreater} GBr {\textgreater}{\textgreater} GI. In inside-out patches, the channels were blocked reversibly by 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, glibenclamide, and diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid, whereas 4, 4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid blocked channel activity completely and irreversibly.

A weak signal is found that shows that amino acid pairs near in space in the folded structure preferentially undergo substitution in a compensatory way. Three different physicochemical types of covariation 'signals' were then examined separately, with consideration given to the evolutionary distance at which different types of compensation occur. Where the compensatory covariation tends towards retaining the combined residue volumes, the signal is significant only at very low evolutionary distances. Where the covariation compensates for changes in the hydrogen bonding, the signal is strongest at intermediate evolutionary distances. Covariations that compensate for charge variations appeared with equal strength at all the evolutionary distances examined. A recipe is suggested for using the weak covariation signal to assemble the predicted secondary structural elements, where the evolutionary distance, covariation type and weighting are considered together with the tertiary structural context (interior or surface) of the residues being examined.},

abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that translocate a wide variety of substrates across cellular membranes and are conserved from bacteria to humans. Here we compare four x-ray structures of the bacterial ABC lipid flippase, MsbA, trapped in different conformations, two nucleotide-bound structures and two in the absence of nucleotide. Comparison of the nucleotide-free conformations of MsbA reveals a flexible hinge formed by extracellular loops 2 and 3. This hinge allows the nucleotide-binding domains to disassociate while the ATP-binding half sites remain facing each other. The binding of the nucleotide causes a packing rearrangement of the transmembrane helices and changes the accessibility of the transporter from cytoplasmic (inward) facing to extracellular (outward) facing. The inward and outward openings are mediated by two different sets of transmembrane helix interactions. Altogether, the conformational changes between these structures suggest that large ranges of motion may be required for substrate transport.},

Here, we report the results of atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations, over periods ranging between 100 $\mu$s and 1 ms, that reveal a set of common principles underlying the folding of 12 structurally diverse proteins. In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

abstract = {Accurately modeling the DNA sequence preferences of transcription factors (TFs), and using these models to predict in vivo genomic binding sites for TFs, are key pieces in deciphering the regulatory code. These efforts have been frustrated by the limited availability and accuracy of TF binding site motifs, usually represented as position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), which may match large numbers of sites and produce an unreliable list of target genes. Recently, protein binding microarray (PBM) experiments have emerged as a new source of high resolution data on in vitro TF binding specificities. PBM data has been analyzed either by estimating PSSMs or via rank statistics on probe intensities, so that individual sequence patterns are assigned enrichment scores (E-scores). This representation is informative but unwieldy because every TF is assigned a list of thousands of scored sequence patterns. Meanwhile, high-resolution in vivo TF occupancy data from ChIP-seq experiments is also increasingly available. We have developed a flexible discriminative framework for learning TF binding preferences from high resolution in vitro and in vivo data. We first trained support vector regression (SVR) models on PBM data to learn the mapping from probe sequences to binding intensities. We used a novel -mer based string kernel called the di-mismatch kernel to represent probe sequence similarities. The SVR models are more compact than E-scores, more expressive than PSSMs, and can be readily used to scan genomics regions to predict in vivo occupancy. Using a large data set of yeast and mouse TFs, we found that our SVR models can better predict probe intensity than the E-score method or PBM-derived PSSMs. Moreover, by using SVRs to score yeast, mouse, and human genomic regions, we were better able to predict genomic occupancy as measured by ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq experiments. Finally, we found that by training kernel-based models directly on ChIP-seq data, we greatly improved in vivo occupancy prediction, and by comparing a TF's in vitro and in vivo models, we could identify cofactors and disambiguate direct and indirect binding.},

abstract = {Intraprotein side chain contacts can couple the evolutionary process of amino acid substitution at one position to that at another. This coupling, known as residue coevolution, may vary in strength. Conserved contacts thus not only define 3-dimensional protein structure, but also indicate which residue-residue interactions are crucial to a protein's function. Therefore, prediction of strongly coevolving residue-pairs helps clarify molecular mechanisms underlying function. Previously, various coevolution detectors have been employed separately to predict these pairs purely from multiple sequence alignments, while disregarding available structural information. This study introduces an integrative framework that improves the accuracy of such predictions, relative to previous approaches, by combining multiple coevolution detectors and incorporating structural contact information. This framework is applied to the ABC-B and ABC-C transporter families, which include the drug exporter P-glycoprotein involved in multidrug resistance of cancer cells, as well as the CFTR chloride channel linked to cystic fibrosis disease. The predicted coevolving pairs are further analyzed based on conformational changes inferred from outward- and inward-facing transporter structures. The analysis suggests that some pairs coevolved to directly regulate conformational changes of the alternating-access transport mechanism, while others to stabilize rigid-body-like components of the protein structure. Moreover, some identified pairs correspond to residues previously implicated in cystic fibrosis.},

We have investigated the assembly pathway of this complex by interfering with the stability of the hydrophobic interaction layers holding the complex together. Mutations in the C-terminal end affected fusion triggering in vivo and led to two-step unfolding of the SNARE complex in vitro, indicating that the C-terminal end can assemble/disassemble independently. Free energy perturbation calculations showed that assembly of the C-terminal end could liberate substantial amounts of energy that may drive fusion. In contrast, similar N-terminal mutations were without effects on exocytosis, and mutations in the middle of the complex selectively interfered with upstream maturation steps (vesicle priming), but not with fusion triggering. We conclude that the SNARE complex forms in the N- to C-terminal direction, and that a partly assembled intermediate corresponds to the primed vesicle state.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The accurate prediction of residue-residue contacts, critical for maintaining the native fold of a protein, remains an open problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. Interest in this long-standing problem has increased recently with algorithmic improvements and the rapid growth in the sizes of sequence families. Progress could have major impacts in both structure and function prediction to name but two benefits. Sequence-based contact predictions are usually made by identifying correlated mutations within multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), most commonly through the information-theoretic approach of calculating mutual information between pairs of sites in proteins. These predictions are often inaccurate because the true covariation signal in the MSA is often masked by biases from many ancillary indirect-coupling or phylogenetic effects. Here we present a novel method, PSICOV, which introduces the use of sparse inverse covariance estimation to the problem of protein contact prediction. Our method builds on work which had previously demonstrated corrections for phylogenetic and entropic correlation noise and allows accurate discrimination of direct from indirectly coupled mutation correlations in the MSA.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PSICOV displays a mean precision substantially better than the best performing normalized mutual information approach and Bayesian networks. For 118 out of 150 targets, the L/5 (i.e. top-L/5 predictions for a protein of length L) precision for long-range contacts (sequence separation {\textgreater}23) was ≥ 0.5, which represents an improvement sufficient to be of significant benefit in protein structure prediction or model quality assessment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: The PSICOV source code can be downloaded from http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/PSICOV.},

abstract = {The advent of high accuracy residue-residue intra-protein contact prediction methods enabled a significant boost in the quality of de novo structure predictions. Here, we investigate the potential benefits of combining a well-established fragment-based folding algorithm – FRAGFOLD, with PSICOV, a contact prediction method which uses sparse inverse covariance estimation to identify co-varying sites in multiple sequence alignments. Using a comprehensive set of 150 diverse globular target proteins, up to 266 amino acids in length, we are able to address the effectiveness and some limitations of such approaches to globular proteins in practice. Overall we find that using fragment assembly with both statistical potentials and predicted contacts is significantly better than either statistical potentials or contacts alone. Results show up to nearly 80{\%} of correct predictions (TM-score ≥0.5) within analysed dataset and a mean TM-score of 0.54. Unsuccessful modelling cases emerged either from conformational sampling problems, or insufficient contact prediction accuracy. Nevertheless, a strong dependency of the quality of final models on the fraction of satisfied predicted long-range contacts was observed. This not only highlights the importance of these contacts on determining the protein fold, but also (combined with other ensemble-derived qualities) provides a powerful guide as to the choice of correct models and the global quality of the selected model. A proposed quality assessment scoring function achieves 0.93 precision and 0.77 recall for the discrimination of correct folds on our dataset of decoys. These findings suggest the approach is well-suited for blind predictions on a variety of globular proteins of unknown 3D structure, provided that enough homologous sequences are available to construct a large and accurate multiple sequence alignment for the initial contact prediction step.},

abstract = {Over the years, there have been claims that evolution proceeds according to systematically different processes over different timescales and that protein evolution behaves in a non-Markovian manner. On the other hand, Markov models are fundamental to many applications in evolutionary studies. Apparent non-Markovian or time-dependent behavior has been attributed to influence of the genetic code at short timescales and dominance of physicochemical properties of the amino acids at long timescales. However, any long time period is simply the accumulation of many short time periods, and it remains unclear why evolution should appear to act systematically differently across the range of timescales studied. We show that the observed time-dependent behavior can be explained qualitatively by modeling protein sequence evolution as an aggregated Markov process (AMP): a time-homogeneous Markovian substitution model observed only at the level of the amino acids encoded by the protein-coding DNA sequence. The study of AMPs sheds new light on the relationship between amino acid-level and codon-level models of sequence evolution, and our results suggest that protein evolution should be modeled at the codon level rather than using amino acid substitution models.},

The analysis is performed independently for the CDS and the 3(')-untranslated regions (3(')-UTRs) and reveals different sets of features and models for the two regions. The two models are combined into a novel computational model for miRNA target genes, DIANA-microT-CDS, which achieves higher sensitivity compared with other popular programs and the model that uses only the 3(')-UTR target sites. Further analysis indicates that genes with shorter 3(')-UTRs are preferentially targeted in the CDS, suggesting that evolutionary selection might favor additional sites on the CDS in cases where there is restricted space on the 3(')-UTR.},

abstract = {Here, a model allowing covarion-like evolution of DNA sequences is introduced. In contrast to standard representation of the distribution of evolutionary rates, this model allows the site-specific rate to vary between lineages. This is achieved by adding as few as two parameters to the widely used among-site rate variation model, namely, (1) the proportion of sites undergoing rate changes and (2) the rate of rate change. This model is implemented in the likelihood framework, allowing parameter estimation, comparison of models, and tree reconstruction. An application to ribosomal RNA sequences suggests that covarions (i.e., site-specific rate changes) play an important role in the evolution of these molecules. Neglecting them results in a severe underestimate of the variance of rates across sites. It has, however, little influence on the estimation of ancestral G+C contents obtained from a nonhomogeneous model, or on the resulting inferences about the evolution of thermophyly. This theoretical effort should be useful for the study of protein adaptation, which presumably proceeds in a typical covarion-like manner.},

abstract = {The motivation of this paper is the application of MCMC model scoring procedures to data mining problems, involving a large number of competing models and other relevant model choice aspects. To achieve this aim we analyze one of the most popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for structural learning in graphical models, namely, the MC 3 algorithm proposed by D. Madigan and J. York (International Statistical Review, 63, 215–232, 1995). Our aim is to improve their algorithm to make it an effective and reliable tool in the field of data mining. In such context, typically highly dimensional in the number of variables, little can be known a priori and, therefore, a good model search algorithm is crucial. We present and describe in detail our implementation of the MC 3 algorithm, which provides an efficient general framework for computations with both Directed Acyclic Graphical (DAG) models and Undirected Decomposable Models (UDG). We believe that the possibility of commuting easily between the two classes of models constitutes an important asset in data mining, where an a priori knowledge of causal effects is usually difficult to establish. Furthermore, in order to improve the MC 3 method we propose provide several graphical monitors which can help extracting results and assessing the goodness of the Markov chain Monte Carlo approximation to the posterior distribution of interest. We apply our proposed methodology first to the well-known coronary heart disease dataset (D. Edwards {\&}; T. Havr{\'{a}}nek, Biometrika, 72:2, 339–351, 1985). We then introduce a novel data mining application which concerns market basket analysis.},

For most cancer types, this landscape consists of a small number of "mountains" (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of "hills" (genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed similar to 140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or "drive" tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight of these "driver gene" mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {Predicting protein structure from primary sequence is one of the ultimate challenges in computational biology. Given the large amount of available sequence data, the analysis of co-evolution, i.e., statistical dependency, between columns in multiple alignments of protein domain sequences remains one of the most promising avenues for predicting residues that are contacting in the structure. A key impediment to this approach is that strong statistical dependencies are also observed for many residue pairs that are distal in the structure. Using a comprehensive analysis of protein domains with available three-dimensional structures we show that co-evolving contacts very commonly form chains that percolate through the protein structure, inducing indirect statistical dependencies between many distal pairs of residues. We characterize the distributions of length and spatial distance traveled by these co-evolving contact chains and show that they explain a large fraction of observed statistical dependencies between structurally distal pairs. We adapt a recently developed Bayesian network model into a rigorous procedure for disentangling direct from indirect statistical dependencies, and we demonstrate that this method not only successfully accomplishes this task, but also allows contacts with weak statistical dependency to be detected. To illustrate how additional information can be incorporated into our method, we incorporate a phylogenetic correction, and we develop an informative prior that takes into account that the probability for a pair of residues to contact depends strongly on their primary-sequence distance and the amount of conservation that the corresponding columns in the multiple alignment exhibit. We show that our model including these extensions dramatically improves the accuracy of contact prediction from multiple sequence alignments.},

abstract = {When protein sequences divergently evolve under functional constraints, some individual amino acid replacements that reverse the charge (e.g. Lys to Asp) may be compensated by a replacement at a second position that reverses the charge in the opposite direction (e.g. Glu to Arg). When these side-chains are near in space (proximal), such double replacements might be driven by natural selection, if either is selectively disadvantageous, but both together restore fully the ability of the protein to contribute to fitness (are together "neutral"). Accordingly, many have sought to identify pairs of positions in a protein sequence that suffer compensatory replacements, often as a way to identify positions near in space in the folded structure. A "charge compensatory signal" might manifest itself in two ways. First, proximal charge compensatory replacements may occur more frequently than predicted from the product of the probabilities of individual positions suffering charge reversing replacements independently. Conversely, charge compensatory pairs of changes may be observed to occur more frequently in proximal pairs of sites than in the average pair. Normally, charge compensatory covariation is detected by comparing the sequences of extant proteins at the "leaves" of phylogenetic trees. We show here that the charge compensatory signal is more evident when it is sought by examining individual branches in the tree between reconstructed ancestral sequences at nodes in the tree. Here, we find that the signal is especially strong when the positions pairs are in a single secondary structural unit (e.g. alpha helix or beta strand) that brings the side-chains suffering charge compensatory covariation near in space, and may be useful in secondary structure prediction. Also, "node-node" and "node-leaf" compensatory covariation may be useful to identify the better of two equally parsimonious trees, in a way that is independent of the mathematical formalism used to construct the tree itself. Further, compensatory covariation may provide a signal that indicates whether an episode of sequence evolution contains more or less divergence in functional behavior. Compensatory covariation analysis on reconstructed evolutionary trees may become a valuable tool to analyze genome sequences, and use these analyses to extract biomedically useful information from proteome databases.},

abstract = {Studies of the native structures of proteins, together with measurements of the thermodynamic properties of the transition between unfolded and native states, have defined the major components of the forces that stabilize native protein structures. However, the nature of the intermediates in the folding process remains largely hypothetical. It is a fairly widespread and not implausible assumption that the intermediates in the folding of a monomeric protein contain the same kinds of secondary and tertiary structures that appear in the native conformation, and that, although unstable, their lifetimes are prolonged by forces similar to those that stabilize the native structure. We wished to examine what happens if, during the folding of a monomeric protein, regions of secondary structure come together to form an intermediate of reduced instability. We applied calculations of accessible surface area (a measure of hydrophobic stabilization) and parameterized nonbonded energy calculations (measuring the strengths of van der Waals forces) to identify the kinds of stabilizing interactions that might be available to such an intermediate. First, we analyzed the total buried surface area of two types of proteins into contributions from formation of secondary structure alone, interaction of pairs of secondary-structural elements, the formation of the structure alone, interaction of pairs of secondary-structural elements, the formation of the complete secondary structure without the turns, and the complete native structure. The formation of secondary structure alone, without tertiary-structural interactions, buries roughly half the surface that the complete structure does. We then analyzed in more detail the approach of two alpha-helices to form a complex, as an illustrative example of the nature of the interaction between compact structural units which remain fairly rigid during their interaction. Many features of the results are not limited to the interaction of alpha-helices. (The results therefore neither confirm nor refute the hypothesis that alpha-helices are intermediates in the folding proteins). We find that the first forces to be felt upon approach arise from solvent conditions on the relative position and orientation of the two helices as does the close packing which optimizes the van der Waals interactions at shorter distances apart. Therefore there appears to be a range of distances in which hydrophobic interactions could create a nonspecific complex between two helices in which the side chains might have sufficient time to seek the proper interdigitation observed in the native structure, where the two helices are in intimate contact. Indeed, we find that only in the final stages of approach is the native geometry the most stable; in the region in which solvent-exclusion forces predominate, the conformation with helix axes parallel is more stable than the native conformation, in the cases we examined...},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reaction of HIV protease to inhibitor therapy is characterized by the emergence of complex mutational patterns which confer drug resistance. The response of HIV protease to drugs often involves both primary mutations that directly inhibit the action of the drug, and a host of accessory resistance mutations that may occur far from the active site but may contribute to restoring the fitness or stability of the enzyme. Here we develop a probabilistic approach based on connected information that allows us to study residue, pair level and higher-order correlations within the same framework. RESULTS: We apply our methodology to a database of approximately 13,000 sequences which have been annotated by the treatment history of the patients from which the samples were obtained. We show that including pair interactions is essential for agreement with the mutational data, since neglect of these interactions results in order-of-magnitude errors in the probabilities of the simultaneous occurence of many mutations. The magnitude of these pair correlations changes dramatically between sequences obtained from patients that were or were not exposed to drugs. Higher-order effects make a contribution of as much as 10{\%} for residues taken three at a time, but increase to more than twice that for 10 to 15-residue groups. The sequence data is insufficient to determine the higher-order effects for larger groups. We find that higher-order interactions have a significant effect on the predicted frequencies of sequences with large numbers of mutations. While relatively rare, such sequences are more prevalent after multi-drug therapy. The relative importance of these higher-order interactions increases with the number of drugs the patient had been exposed to. CONCLUSION: Correlations are critical for the understanding of mutation patterns in HIV protease. Pair interactions have substantial qualitative effects, while higher-order interactions are individually smaller but may have a collective effect. Together they lead to correlations which could have an important impact on the dynamics of the evolution of cross-resistance, by allowing the virus to pass through otherwise unlikely mutational states. These findings also indicate that pairwise and possibly higher-order effects should be included in the models of protein evolution, instead of assuming that all residues mutate independently of one another.},

abstract = {DNA methylation plays a key role in the silencing of numerous cancer-related genes, thereby affecting a number of vital cellular processes, including the cell cycle checkpoint, apoptosis, signal transduction, cell adhesion and angiogenesis. Also widely altered in human malignancies is the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs that act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Furthermore, emerging evidence now supports the idea that DNA methylation is crucially involved in the dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer. This is in part the result of technological advances that enable more comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiles and the epigenome in cancer cells, which has led to the identification of a number of epigenetically regulated miRNAs. As with protein-coding genes, it appears that miRNA genes involved in regulating cancer-related pathways are silenced in association with CpG island hypermethylation. In addition, methylation in CpG island shore regions and DNA hypomethylation also appear to contribute to miRNA dysregulation in cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation of miRNA genes is a potentially useful biomarker for detecting cancer and predicting its outcome. Moreover, re-expression of miRNAs and the replacement of tumor suppressive miRNAs using miRNA mimics or expression vectors could be effective approaches to cancer therapy. ?? 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

abstract = {Regulation by cytosolic nucleotides of Ca2+- and ATP-sensitive nonselective cation channels (CA-NSCs) in rat brain capillary endothelial cells was studied in excised inside-out patches. Open probability (Po) was suppressed by cytosolic nucleotides with apparent KI values of 17, 9, and 2 microM for ATP, ADP, and AMP, as a consequence of high-affinity inhibition of channel opening rate and low-affinity stimulation of closing rate. Cytosolic [Ca2+] and voltage affected inhibition of Po, but not of opening rate, by ATP, suggesting that the conformation of the nucleotide binding site is influenced only by the state of the channel gate, not by that of the Ca2+ and voltage sensors. ATP inhibition was unaltered by channel rundown. Nucleotide structure affected inhibitory potency that was little sensitive to base substitutions, but was greatly diminished by 3'-5' cyclization, removal of all phosphates, or complete omission of the base. In contrast, decavanadate potently (K1/2 = 90 nM) and robustly stimulated Po, and functionally competed with inhibitory nucleotides. From kinetic analyses we conclude that (a) ATP, ADP, and AMP bind to a common site; (b) inhibition by nucleotides occurs through simple reversible binding, as a consequence of tighter binding to the closed-channel relative to the open-channel conformation; (c) the conformation of the nucleotide binding site is not directly modulated by Ca2+ and voltage; (d) the differences in inhibitory potency of ATP, ADP, and AMP reflect their different affinities for the closed channel; and (e) though decavanadate is the only example found to date of a compound that stimulates Po with high affinity even in the presence of millimolar nucleotides, apparently by competing for the nucleotide binding site, a comparable mechanism might allow CA-NSC channels to open in living cells despite physiological levels of nucleotides. Decavanadate now provides a valuable tool for studying native CA-NSC channels and for screening cloned channels.},

abstract = {Experimental studies have shown that some proteins exist in two alternative native-state conformations. It has been proposed that such bi-stable proteins can potentially function as evolutionary bridges at the interface between two neutral networks of protein sequences that fold uniquely into the two different native conformations. Under adaptive conflict scenarios, bi-stable proteins may be of particular advantage if they simultaneously provide two beneficial biological functions. However, computational models that simulate protein structure evolution do not yet recognize the importance of bi-stability. Here we use a biophysical model to analyze sequence space to identify bi-stable or multi-stable proteins with two or more equally stable native-state structures. The inclusion of such proteins enhances phenotype connectivity between neutral networks in sequence space. Consideration of the sequence space neighborhood of bridge proteins revealed that bi-stability decreases gradually with each mutation that takes the sequence further away from an exactly bi-stable protein. With relaxed selection pressures, we found that bi-stable proteins in our model are highly successful under simulated adaptive conflict. Inspired by these model predictions, we developed a method to identify real proteins in the PDB with bridge-like properties, and have verified a clear bi-stability gradient for a series of mutants studied by Alexander et al. (Proc Nat Acad Sci USA 2009, 106:21149-21154) that connect two sequences that fold uniquely into two different native structures via a bridge-like intermediate mutant sequence. Based on these findings, new testable predictions for future studies on protein bi-stability and evolution are discussed.},

abstract = {Cancer metastasis requires that primary tumour cells evolve the capacity to intravasate into the lymphatic system or vasculature, and extravasate into and colonize secondary sites1 . Others have demonstrated that individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary lesions2–5. Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity, and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization, for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature systems. We correlate these stable properties to distinct gene expression profiles. Those clones that efficiently enter the vasculature express two secreted proteins, Serpine2 and Slpi, which were necessary and sufficient to program these cells for vascular mimicry. Our data indicate that these proteins not only drive the formation of extravascular networks but also ensure their perfusion by acting as anticoagulants. We propose that vascular mimicry drives the ability of some breast tumour cells to contribute to distant metastases while simultaneously satisfying a critical need of the primary tumour to be fed by the vasculature. Enforced expression of SERPINE2 and SLPI in human breast cancer cell lines also programmed them for vascular mimicry, and SERPINE2 and SLPI were overexpressed preferentially in human patients that had lung-metastatic relapse. Thus, these two secreted proteins, and the phenotype they promote, may be broadly relevant as drivers of metastatic progression in human cancer.},

abstract = {Opening and closing of a CFTR Cl(-) channel is controlled by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic regulatory (R) domain and by ATP binding, and likely hydrolysis, at its two nucleotide binding domains. Functional interactions between the R domain and the two nucleotide binding domains were probed by characterizing the gating of severed CFTR channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Expression levels were assessed using measurements of oocyte conductance, and detailed functional characteristics of the channels were extracted from kinetic analyses of macroscopic current relaxations and of single-channel gating events in membrane patches excised from the oocytes. The kinetic behavior of wild-type (WT) CFTR channels was compared with that of split CFTR channels bearing a single cut (between residues 633 and 634) just before the R domain, of split channels with a single cut (between residues 835 and 837) just after the R domain, and of split channels from which the entire R domain (residues 634-836) between those two cut sites was omitted. The channels cut before the R domain had characteristics almost identical to those of WT channels, except for less than twofold shorter open burst durations in the presence of PKA. Channels cut just after the R domain were characterized by a low level of activity even without phosphorylation, strong stimulation by PKA, enhanced apparent affinity for ATP as assayed by open probability, and a somewhat destabilized binding site for the locking action of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP. Split channels with no R domain (from coexpression of CFTR segments 1-633 and 837-1480) were highly active without phosphorylation, but otherwise displayed the characteristics of channels cut after the R domain, including higher apparent ATP affinity, and less tight binding of AMPPNP at the locking site, than for WT. Intriguingly, severed channels with no R domain were still noticeably stimulated by PKA, implying that activation of WT CFTR by PKA likely also includes some component unrelated to the R domain. As the maximal opening rates were the same for WT channels and split channels with no R domain, it seems that the phosphorylated R domain does not stimulate opening of CFTR channels; rather, the dephosphorylated R domain inhibits them.},

To demonstrate the logistic feasibility and scientific benefits of randomization and blocking, we conducted a microRNA study of endometrial tumors (n = 96) and ovarian tumors (n = 96) using a blocked randomization design to control for nonbiologic effects; we profiled the same set of tumors for a second time using no blocking or randomization. We assessed empirical evidence of differential expression in the two studies. We performed simulations through virtual rehybridizations to further evaluate the effects of blocking and randomization. There was moderate and asymmetric differential expression (351/3,523, 10{\%}) between endometrial and ovarian tumors in the randomized dataset. Nonbiologic effects were observed in the nonrandomized dataset, and 1,934 markers (55{\%}) were called differentially expressed. Among them, 185 were deemed differentially expressed (185/351, 53{\%}) and 1,749 not differentially expressed (1,749/3,172, 55{\%}) in the randomized dataset. In simulations, when randomization was applied to all samples at once or within batches of samples balanced in tumor groups, blocking improved the true-positive rate from 0.95 to 0.97 and the false-positive rate from 0.02 to 0.002; when sample batches were unbalanced, randomization was associated with the true-positive rate (0.92) and the false-positive rate (0.10) regardless of blocking.

abstract = {Although most of the important evolutionary events in the history of biology can only be studied via interspecific comparisons, it is challenging to apply the rich body of population genetic theory to the study of interspecific genetic variation. Probabilistic modeling of the substitution process would ideally be derived from first principles of population genetics, allowing a quantitative connection to be made between the parameters describing mutation, selection, drift, and the patterns of interspecific variation. There has been progress in reconciling population genetics and interspecific evolution for the case where mutation rates are sufficiently low, but when mutation rates are higher, reconciliation has been hampered due to complications from how the loss or fixation of new mutations can be influenced by linked nonneutral polymorphisms (i.e., the Hill-Robertson effect). To investigate the generation of interspecific genetic variation when concurrent fitness-affecting polymorphisms are common and the Hill-Robertson effect is thereby potentially strong, we used the Wright-Fisher model of population genetics to simulate very many generations of mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. This was done so that the chronological history of advantageous, deleterious, and neutral substitutions could be traced over time along the ancestral lineage. Our simulations show that the process by which a nonrecombining sequence changes over time can markedly deviate from the Markov assumption that is ubiquitous in molecular phylogenetics. In particular, we find tendencies for advantageous substitutions to be followed by deleterious ones and for deleterious substitutions to be followed by advantageous ones. Such non-Markovian patterns reflect the fact that the fate of the ancestral lineage depends not only on its current allelic state but also on gene copies not belonging to the ancestral lineage. Although our simulations describe nonrecombining sequences, we conclude by discussing how non-Markovian behavior of the ancestral lineage is plausible even when recombination rates are not low. As a result, we believe that increased attention needs to be devoted to the robustness of evolutionary inference procedures that rely upon the Markov assumption.},

abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells make many types of primary and processed RNAs that are found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cells. A complete catalogue of these RNAs is not yet available and their characteristic subcellular localizations are also poorly understood. Because RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of a cell's regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a redefinition of the concept of a gene.},

Using synaptic vesicles as a model, we have now determined the protein and lipid composition; measured vesicle size, density, and mass; calculated the average protein and lipid mass per vesicle; and determined the copy number of more than a dozen major constituents. A model has been constructed that integrates all quantitative data and includes structural models of abundant proteins. Synaptic vesicles are dominated by proteins, possess a surprising diversity of trafficking proteins, and, with the exception of the V-ATPase that is present in only one to two copies, contain numerous copies of proteins essential for membrane traffic and neurotransmitter uptake.},

abstract = {Next Generation Sequencing represents a powerful tool for detecting genetic variation associated with human disease. Because of the high cost of this technology, it is critical that we develop efficient study designs that consider the trade-off between the number of subjects (n) and the coverage depth (µ). How we divide our resources between the two can greatly impact study success, particularly in pilot studies. We propose a strategy for selecting the optimal combination of n and µ for studies aimed at detecting rare variants and for studies aimed at detecting associations between rare or uncommon variants and disease. For detecting rare variants, we find the optimal coverage depth to be between 2 and 8 reads when using the likelihood ratio test. For association studies, we find the strategy of sequencing all available subjects to be preferable. In deriving these combinations, we provide a detailed analysis describing the distribution of depth across a genome and the depth needed to identify a minor allele in an individual. The optimal coverage depth depends on the aims of the study, and the chosen depth can have a large impact on study success.},

abstract = {The similarity in the three-dimensional structures of homologous proteins imposes strong constraints on their sequence variability. It has long been suggested that the resulting correlations among amino acid compositions at different sequence positions can be exploited to infer spatial contacts within the tertiary protein structure. Crucial to this inference is the ability to disentangle direct and indirect correlations, as accomplished by the recently introduced direct-coupling analysis (DCA). Here we develop a computationally efficient implementation of DCA, which allows us to evaluate the accuracy of contact prediction by DCA for a large number of protein domains, based purely on sequence information. DCA is shown to yield a large number of correctly predicted contacts, recapitulating the global structure of the contact map for the majority of the protein domains examined. Furthermore, our analysis captures clear signals beyond intradomain residue contacts, arising, e.g., from alternative protein conformations, ligand-mediated residue couplings, and interdomain interactions in protein oligomers. Our findings suggest that contacts predicted by DCA can be used as a reliable guide to facilitate computational predictions of alternative protein conformations, protein complex formation, and even the de novo prediction of protein domain structures, contingent on the existence of a large number of homologous sequences which are being rapidly made available due to advances in genome sequencing.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The prediction of receptor-ligand pairings is an important area of research as intercellular communications are mediated by the successful interaction of these key proteins. As the exhaustive assaying of receptor-ligand pairs is impractical, a computational approach to predict pairings is necessary. We propose a workflow to carry out this interaction prediction task, using a text mining approach in conjunction with a state of the art prediction method, as well as a widely accessible and comprehensive dataset. Among several modern classifiers, random forests have been found to be the best at this prediction task. The training of this classifier was carried out using an experimentally validated dataset of Database of Ligand-Receptor Partners (DLRP) receptor-ligand pairs. New examples, co-cited with the training receptors and ligands, are then classified using the trained classifier. After applying our method, we find that we are able to successfully predict receptor-ligand pairs within the GPCR family with a balanced accuracy of 0.96. Upon further inspection, we find several supported interactions that were not present in the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIPdatabase). We have measured the balanced accuracy of our method resulting in high quality predictions stored in the available database ReLiance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/{\~{}}bioiuser/ReLianceDB/index.php$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: yves.moreau@esat.kuleuven.be; ernesto.iacucci@gmail.com$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {We present a new structurally derived pair-to-pair substitution matrix (P2PMAT). This matrix is constructed from a very large amount of integrated high quality multiple sequence alignments (Blocks) and protein structures. It evaluates the likelihoods of all 160,000 pair-to-pair substitutions. P2PMAT matrix implicitly accounts for evolutionary conservation, correlated mutations, and residue-residue contact potentials. The usefulness of the matrix for structural predictions is shown in this article. Predicting protein residue-residue contacts from sequence information alone, by our method (P2PConPred) is particularly accurate in the protein cores, where it performs better than other basic contact prediction methods (increasing accuracy by 25-60{\%}). The method mean accuracy for protein cores is 24{\%} for 59 diverse families and 34{\%} for a subset of proteins shorter than 100 residues. This is above the level that was recently shown to be sufficient to significantly improve ab initio protein structure prediction. We also demonstrate the ability of our approach to identify native structures within large sets of (300-2000) protein decoys. On the basis of evolutionary information alone our method ranks the native structure in the top 0.3{\%} of the decoys in 4/10 of the sets, and in 8/10 of sets the native structure is ranked in the top 10{\%} of the decoys. The method can, thus, be used to assist filtering wrong models, complementing traditional scoring functions.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive approach for the cloning, expression, and purification of human ABC transporters in the yeast Pichia pastoris. We analyzed the expression of 25 proteins and demonstrate that 11 transporters, including ABCC3, ABCB6, ABCD1, ABCG1, ABCG4, ABCG5, ABCG8, ABCE1, ABCF1, ABCF2, and ABCF3, were expressed at high levels comparable to that of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein). As an example of the purification strategy via tandem affinity chromatography, we purified ABCC3 (MRP3) whose role in the transport of anticancer drugs, bile acids, and glucuronides has been controversial. The yield of ABCC3 was 3.5 mg/100 g of cells in six independent purifications. Purified ABCC3, activated with PC lipids, exhibited significant ATPase activity with a Vmax of 82 +/- 32 nmol min-1 mg-1. The ATPase activity was stimulated by bile acids and glucuronide conjugates, reaching 170 +/- 28 nmol min-1 mg-1, but was not stimulated by a variety of anticancer drugs. The glucuronide conjugates ethinylestradiol-3-glucuronide and 17beta-estradiol-17-glucuronide stimulated the ATPase with relatively high affinities (apparent Km values of 2 and 3 microM, respectively) in contrast to bile acids (apparent Km values of {\textgreater}130 microM), suggesting that glucuronides are the preferred substrates for this transporter. Overall, the availability of a purification system for the production of large quantities of active transporters presents a major step not only toward understanding the role of ABCC3 but also toward future structure-function analysis of other human ABC transporters.},

abstract = {Genome-wide RNA expression data provide a detailed view of an organism's biological state; hence, a dataset measuring expression variation between genetically diverse individuals (eQTL data) may provide important insights into the genetics of complex traits. However, with data from a relatively small number of individuals, it is difficult to distinguish true causal polymorphisms from the large number of possibilities. The problem is particularly challenging in populations with significant linkage disequilibrium, where traits are often linked to large chromosomal regions containing many genes. Here, we present a novel method, Lirnet, that automatically learns a regulatory potential for each sequence polymorphism, estimating how likely it is to have a significant effect on gene expression. This regulatory potential is defined in terms of "regulatory features"-including the function of the gene and the conservation, type, and position of genetic polymorphisms-that are available for any organism. The extent to which the different features influence the regulatory potential is learned automatically, making Lirnet readily applicable to different datasets, organisms, and feature sets. We apply Lirnet both to the human HapMap eQTL dataset and to a yeast eQTL dataset and provide statistical and biological results demonstrating that Lirnet produces significantly better regulatory programs than other recent approaches. We demonstrate in the yeast data that Lirnet can correctly suggest a specific causal sequence variation within a large, linked chromosomal region. In one example, Lirnet uncovered a novel, experimentally validated connection between Puf3-a sequence-specific RNA binding protein-and P-bodies-cytoplasmic structures that regulate translation and RNA stability-as well as the particular causative polymorphism, a SNP in Mkt1, that induces the variation in the pathway.},

abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

Here, we use simulations of purple acid phosphatase evolution to show that amino acid propensities at a position undergo predictable change after an amino acid replacement at that position. After a replacement, the new amino acid and similar amino acids tend to become gradually more acceptable over time at that position. In other words, proteins tend to equilibrate to the presence of an amino acid at a position through replacements at other positions. Such a shift is reminiscent of the spectroscopy effect known as the Stokes shift, where molecules receiving a quantum of energy and moving to a higher electronic state will adjust to the new state and emit a smaller quantum of energy whenever they shift back down to the original ground state. Predictions of changes in stability in real proteins show that mutation reversals become less favorable over time, and thus, broadly support our results. The observation of an evolutionary Stokes shift has profound implications for the study of protein evolution and the modeling of evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {The distributions of log-likelihood ratios (DeltaLL) obtained from fitting ion-channel dwell-time distributions with nested pairs of gating models (Xi, full model; Xi(R), submodel) were studied both theoretically and using simulated data. When Xi is true, DeltaLL is asymptotically normally distributed with predictable mean and variance that increase linearly with data length (n). When Xi(R) is true and corresponds to a distinct point in full parameter space, DeltaLL is Gamma-distributed (2DeltaLL is chi-square). However, when data generated by an l-component multiexponential distribution are fitted by l+1 components, Xi(R) corresponds to an infinite set of points in parameter space. The distribution of DeltaLL is a mixture of two components, one identically zero, the other approximated by a Gamma-distribution. This empirical distribution of DeltaLL, assuming Xi(R), allows construction of a valid log-likelihood ratio test. The log-likelihood ratio test, the Akaike information criterion, and the Schwarz criterion all produce asymmetrical Type I and II errors and inefficiently recognize Xi, when true, from short datasets. A new decision strategy, which considers both the parameter estimates and DeltaLL, yields more symmetrical errors and a larger discrimination power for small n. These observations are explained by the distributions of DeltaLL when Xi or Xi(R) is true.},

  abstract      = {Inherited alleles account for most of the genetic risk for schizophrenia. However, new (de novo) mutations, in the form of large chromosomal copy number changes, occur in a small fraction of cases and disproportionally disrupt genes encoding postsynaptic proteins. Here we show that small de novo mutations, affecting one or a few nucleotides, are overrepresented among glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes. Mutations are additionally enriched in proteins that interact with these complexes to modulate synaptic strength, namely proteins regulating actin filament dynamics and those whose messenger RNAs are targets of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Genes affected by mutations in schizophrenia overlap those mutated in autism and intellectual disability, as do mutation-enriched synaptic pathways. Aligning our findings with a parallel case-control study, we demonstrate reproducible insights into aetiological mechanisms for schizophrenia and reveal pathophysiology shared with other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

abstract = {The Na/K pump usually pumps more Na+ out of the cell than K+ in, and so generates an outward component of membrane current which, in the heart, can be an important modulator of the frequency and shape of the cardiac impulse. Because it is electrogenic, Na/K pump activity ought to be sensitive to membrane potential, and it should decline with hyperpolarization. However, such voltage dependence of outward pump current has yet to be demonstrated, one reason being the technical difficulty of accurately measuring pump current over a sufficiently wide voltage range. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique allows effective control of both intracellular and extracellular solutions as well as membrane voltage. Applying this technique to myocardial cells isolated from guinea pig ventricle, we have measured Na/K pump current between -140 mV and +60 mV, after minimizing passive currents flowing through Ca2+, K+ and Na+ channels. We report here that strongly activated pump current shows marked voltage dependence; it declines steadily from a maximal level near 0 mV, becoming very small at -140 mV. Pump current-voltage relationships will provide essential information for testing models of the Na/K pump mechanism and for predicting pump-mediated changes in the electrical activity of excitable cells.},

We show that the frequency of IBD pairs is population dependent and can be used to cluster individuals into populations, detect a homogeneous subpopulation within a larger cohort, and infer bottleneck events in such a subpopulation. Specifically, we show that Ashkenazi Jewish individuals are all connected through transitive remote family ties evident by sharing of 50 cM IBD to a publicly available data set of less than 400 individuals. We further expose regions where long-range haplotypes are shared significantly more often than elsewhere in the genome, observed across multiple populations, and enriched for common long structural variation. These are inconsistent with recent relatedness and suggest ancient common ancestry, with limited recombination between haplotypes.},

abstract = {Monozygotic or 'identical' twins have been widely studied to dissect the relative contributions of genetics and environment in human diseases. In multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease and common cause of neurodegeneration and disability in young adults, disease discordance in monozygotic twins has been interpreted to indicate environmental importance in its pathogenesis. However, genetic and epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins have been described, challenging the accepted experimental model in disambiguating the effects of nature and nurture. Here we report the genome sequences of one MS-discordant monozygotic twin pair, and messenger RNA transcriptome and epigenome sequences of CD4(+) lymphocytes from three MS-discordant, monozygotic twin pairs. No reproducible differences were detected between co-twins among approximately 3.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or approximately 0.2 million insertion-deletion polymorphisms. Nor were any reproducible differences observed between siblings of the three twin pairs in HLA haplotypes, confirmed MS-susceptibility SNPs, copy number variations, mRNA and genomic SNP and insertion-deletion genotypes, or the expression of approximately 19,000 genes in CD4(+) T cells. Only 2 to 176 differences in the methylation of approximately 2 million CpG dinucleotides were detected between siblings of the three twin pairs, in contrast to approximately 800 methylation differences between T cells of unrelated individuals and several thousand differences between tissues or between normal and cancerous tissues. In the first systematic effort to estimate sequence variation among monozygotic co-twins, we did not find evidence for genetic, epigenetic or transcriptome differences that explained disease discordance. These are the first, to our knowledge, female, twin and autoimmune disease individual genome sequences reported.},

However, the allele is not subject to selection on its effects on patrilineal kin when maternally derived nor on its effects on matrilineal kin when paternally derived. As a result, natural selection may favor alleles with effects that differ, depending on the allele's parental origin. At autosomal loci, this process is predicted to lead to the silencing of alleles when inherited from one or the other parent. At X-linked loci subject to random X inactivation, the process is predicted to lead to quantitative differences of expression between maternal and paternal alleles but not to complete silencing of one allele. The implications of this theory and some challenges to the theory are reviewed.},

The randomized dataset was assessed for differential expression between two tumor groups and treated as the benchmark. The non-randomized dataset was assessed for differential expression after normalization and compared against the benchmark. Normalization improved the true positive rate significantly in the non-randomized data but still possessed a false discovery rate as high as 50{\%}. Adding a batch adjustment step before normalization further reduced the number of false positive markers while maintaining a similar number of true positive markers, which resulted in a false discovery rate of 32{\%} to 48{\%}, depending on the specific normalization method. We concluded the paper with some insights on possible causes of false discoveries to shed light on how to improve normalization for microRNA arrays.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate determination of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from next-generation sequencing data is a significant challenge facing bioinformatics researchers. Most current methods use mechanistic models that assume nucleotides aligning to a given reference position are sampled from a binomial distribution. While such methods are sensitive, they are often unable to discriminate errors resulting from misaligned reads, sequencing errors or platform artifacts from true variants. RESULTS: To enable more accurate SNP calling, we developed an algorithm that uses a trained support vector machine (SVM) to determine variants from .BAM or .SAM formatted alignments of sequence reads. Our SVM-based implementation determines SNPs with significantly greater sensitivity and specificity than alternative platforms, including the UnifiedGenotyper included with the Genome Analysis Toolkit, samtools and FreeBayes. In addition, the quality scores produced by our implementation more accurately reflect the likelihood that a variant is real when compared with those produced by the Genome Analysis Toolkit. While results depend on the model used, the implementation includes tools to easily build new models and refine existing models with additional training data.

abstract = {Understanding protein structure is of crucial importance in science, medicine and biotechnology. For about two decades, knowledge-based potentials based on pairwise distances – so-called “potentials of mean force” (PMFs) – have been center stage in the prediction and design of protein structure and the simulation of protein folding. However, the validity, scope and limitations of these potentials are still vigorously debated and disputed, and the optimal choice of the reference state – a necessary component of these potentials – is an unsolved problem. PMFs are loosely justified by analogy to the reversible work theorem in statistical physics, or by a statistical argument based on a likelihood function. Both justifications are insightful but leave many questions unanswered. Here, we show for the first time that PMFs can be seen as approximations to quantities that do have a rigorous probabilistic justification: they naturally arise when probability distributions over different features of proteins need to be combined. We call these quantities “reference ratio distributions” deriving from the application of the “reference ratio method.” This new view is not only of theoretical relevance but leads to many insights that are of direct practical use: the reference state is uniquely defined and does not require external physical insights; the approach can be generalized beyond pairwise distances to arbitrary features of protein structure; and it becomes clear for which purposes the use of these quantities is justified. We illustrate these insights with two applications, involving the radius of gyration and hydrogen bonding. In the latter case, we also show how the reference ratio method can be iteratively applied to sculpt an energy funnel. Our results considerably increase the understanding and scope of energy functions derived from known biomolecular structures.},

abstract = {1. A voltage-clamp technique for the measurement of effective membrane capacity is described and its theoretical basis given in an Appendix. Unlike most other methods used so far, the present technique does not depend on the assumption of a particular equivalent circuit for muscle membrane.2. With this technique, we have re-examined the effect of media of low ion content on the effective membrane capacity C(eff). In fibres where potassium conductance is blocked by Rb, C(eff) failed to show any appreciable dependence on ionic strength (between 0.015 and 0.29 M) or conductivity (between 0.86 and 13.4 mmho/cm) of the bathing medium.3. Low conductivity can reduce C(eff) in fibres of moderately high K-conductance. However, in all cases explored here, C(eff) had values well above the 2 muF/cm(2) found in glycerol-treated fibres, indicating that passive spread of potential displacements from surface into the tubular system could still occur.4. The changes in C(eff) observed under conditions of moderately high K-conductance are explicable as a result of potential decrements in the transverse tubules, which would be expected when the wall conductance there is high, and the conductivity of the tubule lumen is low.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Accurate genomic variant detection is an essential step in gleaning medically useful information from genome data. However, low concordance among variant-calling methods reduces confidence in the clinical validity of whole genome and exome sequence data, and confounds downstream analysis for applications in genome medicine.Here we describe BAYSIC (BAYeSian Integrated Caller), which combines SNP variant calls produced by different methods (e.g. GATK, FreeBayes, Atlas, SamTools, etc.) into a more accurate set of variant calls. BAYSIC differs from majority voting, consensus or other ad hoc intersection-based schemes for combining sets of genome variant calls. Unlike other classification methods, the underlying BAYSIC model does not require training using a "gold standard" of true positives. Rather, with each new dataset, BAYSIC performs an unsupervised, fully Bayesian latent class analysis to estimate false positive and false negative error rates for each input method. The user specifies a posterior probability threshold according to the user's tolerance for false positive and false negative errors; lowering the posterior probability threshold allows the user to trade specificity for sensitivity while raising the threshold increases specificity in exchange for sensitivity. RESULTS We assessed the performance of BAYSIC in comparison to other variant detection methods using ten low coverage ({\~{}}5X) samples from The 1000 Genomes Project, a tumor/normal exome pair (40X), and exome sequences (40X) from positive control samples previously identified to contain clinically relevant SNPs. We demonstrated BAYSIC's superior variant-calling accuracy, both for somatic mutation detection and germline variant detection. CONCLUSIONS BAYSIC provides a method for combining sets of SNP variant calls produced by different variant calling programs. The integrated set of SNP variant calls produced by BAYSIC improves the sensitivity and specificity of the variant calls used as input. In addition to combining sets of germline variants, BAYSIC can also be used to combine sets of somatic mutations detected in the context of tumor/normal sequencing experiments.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many computerized methods for RNA secondary structure prediction have been developed. Few of these methods, however, employ an evolutionary model, thus relevant information is often left out from the structure determination. This paper introduces a method which incorporates evolutionary history into RNA secondary structure prediction. The method reported here is based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) to give a prior probability distribution of structures. RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree relating the sequences can be found by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation from the model introduced here. The tree is shown to reveal information about the structure, due to mutation patterns. The inclusion of a prior distribution of RNA structures ensures good structure predictions even for a small number of related sequences. Prediction is carried out using maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) estimation in a Bayesian approach. For small sequence sets, the method performs very well compared to current automated methods.},

abstract = {The accuracy of replicating the genetic code is fundamental. DNA repair mechanisms protect the fidelity of the genome ensuring a low error rate between generations. This sustains the similarity of individuals whilst providing a repertoire of variants for evolution. The mutation rate in the human genome has recently been measured to be 50-70 de novo single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between generations. During development mutations accumulate in somatic cells so that an organism is a mosaic. However, variation within a tissue and between tissues has not been analysed. By reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), their genomes and the associated mutational history are captured. By sequencing the genomes of polyclonal and monoclonal somatic cells and derived iPSCs we have determined the mutation rates and show how the patterns change from a somatic lineage in vivo through to iPSCs. Somatic cells have a mutation rate of 14 SNVs per cell per generation while iPSCs exhibited a ten-fold lower rate. Analyses of mutational signatures suggested that deamination of methylated cytosine may be the major mutagenic source in vivo, whilst oxidative DNA damage becomes dominant in vitro. Our results provide insights for better understanding of mutational processes and lineage relationships between human somatic cells. Furthermore it provides a foundation for interpretation of elevated mutation rates and patterns in cancer.},

abstract = {Freshwater planarian flatworms possess uncanny regenerative capacities mediated by abundant and collectively totipotent adult stem cells. Key functions of these cells during regeneration and tissue homeostasis have been shown to depend on PIWI, a molecule required for Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) expression in planarians. Nevertheless, the full complement of piRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) in this organism has yet to be defined. Here we report on the large-scale cloning and sequencing of small RNAs from the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, yielding altogether millions of sequenced, unique small RNAs. We show that piRNAs are in part organized in genomic clusters and that they share characteristic features with mammalian and fly piRNAs. We further identify 61 novel miRNA genes and thus double the number of known planarian miRNAs. Sequencing, as well as quantitative PCR of small RNAs, uncovered 10 miRNAs enriched in planarian stem cells. These miRNAs are down-regulated in animals in which stem cells have been abrogated by irradiation, and thus constitute miRNAs likely associated with specific stem-cell functions. Altogether, we present the first comprehensive small RNA analysis in animals belonging to the third animal superphylum, the Lophotrochozoa, and single out a number of miRNAs that may function in regeneration. Several of these miRNAs are deeply conserved in animals.},

CheY, Spo0F, and NtrC have unrelated functions and low sequence homology but share an identical topology. Recent coarse-grained simulations show that their folding landscapes are uniquely tuned to properly suit their respective biological functions. Enhanced packing in Spo0F and its limited conformational dynamics compared to CheY or NtrC lead to frustration in its folding landscape. Simulation as well as experimental results correlate with the local density of native contacts for these and a sample of other proteins. In particular, protein regions of low contact density are observed to become structured late in folding; concomitantly, these dynamic regions are often involved in binding or conformational rearrangements of functional importance. These observations help to explain the widespread success of Gō-like coarse-grained models in reproducing protein dynamics.},

abstract = {We analysed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA methylation, exome sequencing, messenger RNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at {\textgreater}10{\%} incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the luminal A subtype. We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype. Comparison of basal-like breast tumours with high-grade serous ovarian tumours showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities. The biological finding of the four main breast cancer subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Most current models of sequence evolution assume that all sites of a protein evolve under the same substitution process, characterized by a 20 x 20 substitution matrix. Here, we propose to relax this assumption by developing a Bayesian mixture model that allows the amino-acid replacement pattern at different sites of a protein alignment to be described by distinct substitution processes. Our model, named CAT, assumes the existence of distinct processes (or classes) differing by their equilibrium frequencies over the 20 residues. Through the use of a Dirichlet process prior, the total number of classes and their respective amino-acid profiles, as well as the affiliations of each site to a given class, are all free variables of the model. In this way, the CAT model is able to adapt to the complexity actually present in the data, and it yields an estimate of the substitutional heterogeneity through the posterior mean number of classes. We show that a significant level of heterogeneity is present in the substitution patterns of proteins, and that the standard one-matrix model fails to account for this heterogeneity. By evaluating the Bayes factor, we demonstrate that the standard model is outperformed by CAT on all of the data sets which we analyzed. Altogether, these results suggest that the complexity of the pattern of substitution of real sequences is better captured by the CAT model, offering the possibility of studying its impact on phylogenetic reconstruction and its connections with structure-function determinants.},

abstract = {The maltose transport complex of Escherichia coli, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, is made up of two nucleotide-binding subunits, MalK(2), which hydrolyze ATP with positive cooperativity, and two transmembrane subunits, MalF and MalG. The ABC family is defined in part by the canonical signature motif LSGGQ whose exact function remains controversial. Taking advantage of the dual function of vanadate as a transition state analogue and as a photoactive chemical, we demonstrate that vanadate catalyzes the UV-dependent cleavage of the polypeptide backbone at both the LSGGQ motif and the nucleotide-binding, or Walker A, motif when it is trapped in the nucleotide-binding site of the bacterial maltose transporter. This highly specific cleavage pattern indicates that residues in both motifs are immediately adjacent to ATP during hydrolysis, and are therefore likely to participate directly in ATP-binding and/or hydrolysis. Because the LSGGQ motif is too distant from the nucleotide in the structure of an ABC monomer for cleavage to occur, these data support a model in which the LSGGQ motif contacts the nucleotide across the interface of a MalK dimer, as seen in the crystal structure of Rad50. This architecture provides a basis for the cooperativity observed in the nucleotide-binding domains of ABC transporters and a function for this highly conserved family signature motif.},

abstract = {Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

This article expresses no views on the ethical aspects of these recommendations and focuses strictly on liability risks and how to minimize them. The recommendations place labs and clinicians in a new liability environment that exposes them to intentional tort lawsuits as well to traditional suits for negligence. Intentional tort suits are especially troubling because of their potential to inflict ruinous personal financial losses on individual clinicians and laboratory personnel. This article surveys this new liability landscape and describes analytical approaches for minimizing tort liabilities. To a considerable degree, liability risks can be controlled by structuring activities in ways that make future lawsuits nonviable before the suits ever arise. Proactive liability analysis is an effective tool for minimizing tort liabilities in connection with the testing and reporting activities that the ACMG recommends.},

abstract = {Glial cells were long considered end products of neural differentiation, specialized supportive cells with an origin very different from that of neurons. New studies have shown that some glial cells--radial glia (RG) in development and specific subpopulations of astrocytes in adult mammals--function as primary progenitors or neural stem cells (NSCs). This is a fundamental departure from classical views separating neuronal and glial lineages early in development. Direct visualization of the behavior of NSCs and lineage-tracing studies reveal how neuronal lineages emerge. In development and in the adult brain, many neurons and glial cells are not the direct progeny of NSCs, but instead originate from transit amplifying, or intermediate, progenitor cells (IPCs). Within NSCs and IPCs, genetic programs unfold for generating the extraordinary diversity of cell types in the central nervous system. The timing in development and location of NSCs, a property tightly linked to their neuroepithelial origin, appear to be the key determinants of the types of neurons generated. Identification of NSCs and IPCs is critical to understand brain development and adult neurogenesis and to develop new strategies for brain repair.},

By representing amino acid residues in protein chains by C alpha atoms, the protein is described as a set of points in three-dimensional space. Delaunay tessellation of a protein structure generates an aggregate of space-filling irregular tetrahedra, or Delaunay simplices. The vertices of each simplex define objectively four nearest neighbor C alpha atoms, i.e., four nearest-neighbor residues. A simplex classification scheme is introduced in which simplices are divided into five classes based on the relative positions of vertex residues in protein primary sequence. Statistical analysis of the residue composition of Delaunay simplices reveals nonrandom preferences for certain quadruplets of amino acids to be clustered together. This nonrandom preference may be used to develop a four-body potential that can be used in evaluating sequence-structure compatibility for the purpose of inverted structure prediction.},

Hardly any [phylogenetic] tree-reconstruction methods meet this simple requirement." The ability to reject models is of such great importance because the results of all phylogenetic analyses depend on their underlying models--to have confidence in the inferences, it is necessary to have confidence in the models. In this paper, a test statistic suggested by Cox is employed to test the adequacy of some statistical models of DNA sequence evolution used in the phylogenetic inference method introduced by Felsenstein. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess significance levels. The resulting statistical tests provide an objective and very general assessment of all the components of a DNA substitution model; more specific versions of the test are devised to test individual components of a model. In all cases, the new analyses have the additional advantage that values of phylogenetic parameters do not have to be assumed in order to perform the tests.},

Eighteen significantly mutated genes were identified, including five genes (RUNX1, CBFB, MYH9, MLL3 and SF3B1) previously linked to haematopoietic disorders. Mutant MAP3K1 was associated with luminal A status, low-grade histology and low proliferation rates, whereas mutant TP53 was associated with the opposite pattern. Moreover, mutant GATA3 correlated with suppression of proliferation upon aromatase inhibitor treatment. Pathway analysis demonstrated that mutations in MAP2K4, a MAP3K1 substrate, produced similar perturbations as MAP3K1 loss. Distinct phenotypes in oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer are associated with specific patterns of somatic mutations that map into cellular pathways linked to tumour biology, but most recurrent mutations are relatively infrequent. Prospective clinical trials based on these findings will require comprehensive genome sequencing.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins are useful for inferring their phylogenetic history and to reveal functionally important regions in the proteins. Functional constraints may lead to co-variation of two or more amino acids in the sequence, such that a substitution at one site is accompanied by compensatory substitutions at another site. It is not sufficient to find the statistical correlations between sites in the alignment because these may be the result of several undetermined causes. In particular, phylogenetic clustering will lead to many strong correlations. RESULTS: A procedure is developed to detect statistical correlations stemming from functional interaction by removing the strong phylogenetic signal that leads to the correlations of each site with many others in the sequence. Our method relies upon the accuracy of the alignment but it does not require any assumptions about the phylogeny or the substitution process. The effectiveness of the method was verified using computer simulations and then applied to predict functional interactions between amino acids in the Pfam database of alignments.},

The aim of this study was to develop an NGS-based workflow for routine diagnostics for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOCS), to improve genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2. A NGS-based workflow was designed using BRCA MASTR kit amplicon libraries followed by GS Junior pyrosequencing. Data analysis combined Variant Identification Pipeline freely available software and ad hoc R scripts, including a cascade of filters to generate coverage and variant calling reports. A BRCA homopolymer assay was performed in parallel. A research scheme was designed in two parts. A Training Set of 28 DNA samples containing 23 unique pathogenic mutations and 213 other variants (33 unique) was used. The workflow was validated in a set of 14 samples from HBOCS families in parallel with the current diagnostic workflow (Validation Set). The NGS-based workflow developed permitted the identification of all pathogenic mutations and genetic variants, including those located in or close to homopolymers. The use of NGS for detecting copy-number alterations was also investigated. The workflow meets the sensitivity and specificity requirements for the genetic diagnosis of HBOCS and improves on the cost-effectiveness of current approaches.},

abstract = {The Wiggle series are support vector machine-based predictors that identify regions of functional flexibility using only protein sequence information. Functionally flexible regions are defined as regions that can adopt different conformational states and are assumed to be necessary for bioactivity. Many advances have been made in understanding the relationship between protein sequence and structure. This work contributes to those efforts by making strides to understand the relationship between protein sequence and flexibility. A coarse-grained protein dynamic modeling approach was used to generate the dataset required for support vector machine training. We define our regions of interest based on the participation of residues in correlated large-scale fluctuations. Even with this structure-based approach to computationally define regions of functional flexibility, predictors successfully extract sequence-flexibility relationships that have been experimentally confirmed to be functionally important. Thus, a sequence-based tool to identify flexible regions important for protein function has been created. The ability to identify functional flexibility using a sequence based approach complements structure-based definitions and will be especially useful for the large majority of proteins with unknown structures. The methodology offers promise to identify structural genomics targets amenable to crystallization and the possibility to engineer more flexible or rigid regions within proteins to modify their bioactivity.},

abstract = {Motivation: The importance of fast and affordable DNA sequencing methods for current day life sciences, medicine and biotechnology is hard to overstate. A major player is Ion Torrent, a pyrosequencing-like technology which produces flowgrams - sequences of incorporation values - which are converted into nucleotide sequences by a base-calling algorithm. Because of its exploitation of ubiquitous semiconductor technology and innovation in chemistry, Ion Torrent has been gaining popularity since its debut in 2011. Despite the advantages, however, Ion Torrent read accuracy remains a significant concern. Results: We present FlowgramFixer, a new algorithm for converting flowgrams into reads. Our key observation is that the incorporation signals of neighboring flows, even after normalization and phase correction, carry considerable mutual information and are important in making the correct base-call. We therefore propose that base-calling of flowgrams should be done on a read-wide level, rather than one flow at a time. We show that this can be done in linear-time by combining a state machine with a Viterbi algorithm to find the nucleotide sequence that maximizes the likelihood of the observed flowgram. FlowgramFixer is applicable to any flowgram-based sequencing platform. We demonstrate FlowgramFixer's superior performance on Ion Torrent Escherichia coli data, with a 4.8{\%} improvement in the number of high-quality mapped reads and a 7.1{\%} improvement in the number of uniquely mappable reads.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Somatic mutation-calling based on DNA from matched tumor-normal patient samples is one of the key tasks carried by many cancer genome projects. One such large-scale project is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which is now routinely compiling catalogs of somatic mutations from hundreds of paired tumor-normal DNA exome-sequence data. Nonetheless, mutation calling is still very challenging. TCGA benchmark studies revealed that even relatively recent mutation callers from major centers showed substantial discrepancies. Evaluation of the mutation callers or understanding the sources of discrepancies is not straightforward, since for most tumor studies, validation data based on independent whole-exome DNA sequencing is not available, only partial validation data for a selected (ascertained) subset of sites. RESULTS To provide guidelines to comparing outputs from multiple callers, we have analyzed two sets of mutation-calling data from the TCGA benchmark studies and their partial validation data. Various aspects of the mutation-calling outputs were explored to characterize the discrepancies in detail. To assess the performances of multiple callers, we introduce four approaches utilizing the external sequence data to varying degrees, ranging from having independent DNA-seq pairs, RNA-seq for tumor samples only, the original exome-seq pairs only, or none of those. CONCLUSIONS Our analyses provide guidelines to visualizing and understanding the discrepancies among the outputs from multiple callers. Furthermore, applying the four evaluation approaches to the whole exome data, we illustrate the challenges and highlight the various circumstances that require extra caution in assessing the performances of multiple callers.},

Each dataset is represented via a kernel function, which defines generalized similarity relationships between pairs of entities, such as genes or proteins. The kernel representation is both flexible and efficient, and can be applied to many different types of data. Furthermore, kernel functions derived from different types of data can be combined in a straightforward fashion. Recent advances in the theory of kernel methods have provided efficient algorithms to perform such combinations in a way that minimizes a statistical loss function. These methods exploit semidefinite programming techniques to reduce the problem of finding optimizing kernel combinations to a convex optimization problem. Computational experiments performed using yeast genome-wide datasets, including amino acid sequences, hydropathy profiles, gene expression data and known protein-protein interactions, demonstrate the utility of this approach. A statistical learning algorithm trained from all of these data to recognize particular classes of proteins--membrane proteins and ribosomal proteins--performs significantly better than the same algorithm trained on any single type of data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY:Supplementary data at http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/sdp-svm},

@article{Baldassi2014,
abstract = {In the course of evolution, proteins show a remarkable conservation of their three-dimensional structure and their biological function, leading to strong evolutionary constraints on the sequence variability between homologous proteins. Our method aims at extracting such constraints from rapidly accumulating sequence data, and thereby at inferring protein structure and function from sequence information alone. Recently, global statistical inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling analysis, sparse inverse covariance estimation) have achieved a breakthrough towards this aim, and their predictions have been successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature of the underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference requires exponential time in the protein length, and efficient approximations are needed for practical applicability. Here we propose a very efficient multivariate Gaussian modeling approach as a variant of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete amino-acid variables are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables. The resulting statistical inference problem is efficiently and exactly solvable. We show that the quality of inference is comparable or superior to the one achieved by mean-field approximations to inference with discrete variables, as done by direct-coupling analysis. This is true for (i) the prediction of residue-residue contacts in proteins, and (ii) the identification of protein-protein interaction partner in bacterial signal transduction. An implementation of our multivariate Gaussian approach is available at the website http://areeweb.polito.it/ricerca/cmp/code.},

DNA replication creates opportunities for mutation, and the timing of DNA replication correlates with the density of SNPs across the human genome. To enable deeper investigation of how DNA replication timing relates to human mutation and variation, we generated a high-resolution map of the human genome's replication timing program and analyzed its relationship to point mutations, copy number variations, and the meiotic recombination hotspots utilized by males and females. DNA replication timing associated with point mutations far more strongly than predicted from earlier analyses and showed a stronger relationship to transversion than transition mutations. Structural mutations arising from recombination-based mechanisms and recombination hotspots used more extensively by females were enriched in early-replicating parts of the genome, though these relationships appeared to relate more strongly to the genomic distribution of causative sequence features. These results indicate differential and sex-specific relationship of DNA replication timing to different forms of mutation and recombination.},

abstract = {Rapidly evolving viruses such as HIV-1 display extensive sequence variation in response to host-specific selection, while simultaneously maintaining functions that are critical to replication and infectivity. This apparent conflict between diversifying and purifying selection may be resolved by an abundance of epistatic interactions such that the same functional requirements can be met by highly divergent sequences. We investigate this hypothesis by conducting an extensive characterization of sequence variation in the HIV-1 nef gene that encodes a highly variable multifunctional protein. Population-based sequences were obtained from 686 patients enrolled in the HOMER cohort in British Columbia, Canada, from which the distribution of nonsynonymous substitutions in the phylogeny was reconstructed by maximum likelihood. We used a phylogenetic comparative method on these data to identify putative epistatic interactions between residues. Two interactions (Y120/Q125 and N157/S169) were chosen to further investigate within-host evolution using HIV-1 RNA extractions from plasma samples from eight patients. Clonal sequencing confirmed strong linkage between polymorphisms at these sites in every case. We used massively parallel pyrosequencing (MPP) to reconstruct within-host evolution in these patients. Experimental error associated with MPP was quantified by performing replicates at two different stages of the protocol, which were pooled prior to analysis to reduce this source of variation. Phylogenetic reconstruction from these data revealed correlated substitutions at Y120/Q125 or N157/S169 repeated across multiple lineages in every host, indicating convergent within-host evolution shaped by epistatic interactions.},

Moreover, we search for signatures associated with tumor stage, immunohistochemistry and tumor molecular profile. Twenty formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) BCs, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCAX and SBC, five per group were studied. Affymetrix platform miRNA v.3.0 was used to perform miR expression analysis. ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. BRCA1, BRCA2 and RASSF1 methylation analysis, AURKA copy number variations, and BRCA1 and BRCA2 deletions, were studied by MLPA. We validated eight of the miR selected by the arrays in 77 BCs by qRT-PCR. The miR profiles associated with tumor features were studied applying the Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis. MiR discrimination capability to distinguish hereditary and non-hereditary BC was analyzed by the discriminant function. With 15 out of 1,733 hsa-miRs, it was possible to differentiate the four groups. BRCA1, BRCA2 and SBC were associated with clusters of hyper-expressed miRs, and BRCAX with hypo-expressed miRs. Hsa-miR-4417 and hsa-miR-423-3p expressions (included among the eight validated miRs) differentiated 70.1 {\%} of hereditary and non-hereditary BCs. We found miR profiles associated with tumor features like node involvement, histological grade, ER, PR and HER2 expression. Regarding molecular parameters, we only found a weak association of miRs in BC harboring losses in AURKA. We conclude that array miR expression profiles can differentiate the four study groups using FFPE BC. However, miRs expression estimated by qRT-PCR differentiates only hereditary and non-inherited BCs. The miR expression array is a simple and rapid approach that could be useful to facilitate the identification of those SBC carrying genetic or epigenetic changes in BRCA genes responsible of BRCA-like phenotype. These patients could benefit from the treatment with PARP inhibitors.},

The thrust of the method involves putting more trust in the comparison of recently diverged sequences than in those evolved in the distant past. In particular, this rule is followed: "once a gap, always a gap." The method has been applied to three sets of protein sequences: 7 superoxide dismutases, 11 globins, and 9 tyrosine kinase-like sequences. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees for these sets of sequences were determined and compared with trees derived by conventional pairwise treatments. In several instances, the progressive method led to trees that appeared to be more in line with biological expectations than were trees obtained by more commonly used methods.},

abstract = {In the Bayesian paradigm, a common method for comparing two models is to compute the Bayes factor, defined as the ratio of their respective marginal likelihoods. In recent phylogenetic works, the numerical evaluation of marginal likelihoods has often been performed using the harmonic mean estimation procedure. In the present article, we propose to employ another method, based on an analogy with statistical physics, called thermodynamic integration. We describe the method, propose an implementation, and show on two analytical examples that this numerical method yields reliable estimates. In contrast, the harmonic mean estimator leads to a strong overestimation of the marginal likelihood, which is all the more pronounced as the model is higher dimensional. As a result, the harmonic mean estimator systematically favors more parameter-rich models, an artefact that might explain some recent puzzling observations, based on harmonic mean estimates, suggesting that Bayes factors tend to overscore complex models. Finally, we apply our method to the comparison of several alternative models of amino-acid replacement. We confirm our previous observations, indicating that modeling pattern heterogeneity across sites tends to yield better models than standard empirical matrices.},

abstract = {Numerous new disease-gene associations have been identified by whole-exome sequencing studies in the last few years. However, many cases remain unsolved due to the sheer number of candidate variants remaining after common filtering strategies such as removing low quality and common variants and those deemed unlikely to be pathogenic. The observation that each of our genomes contains about 100 genuine loss-of-function variants makes identification of the causative mutation problematic when using these strategies alone. We propose using the wealth of genotype to phenotype data that already exists from model organism studies to assess the potential impact of these exome variants. Here, we introduce PHenotypic Interpretation of Variants in Exomes (PHIVE), an algorithm that integrates the calculation of phenotype similarity between human diseases and genetically modified mouse models with evaluation of the variants according to allele frequency, pathogenicity, and mode of inheritance approaches in our Exomiser tool. Large-scale validation of PHIVE analysis using 100,000 exomes containing known mutations demonstrated a substantial improvement (up to 54.1-fold) over purely variant-based (frequency and pathogenicity) methods with the correct gene recalled as the top hit in up to 83{\%} of samples, corresponding to an area under the ROC curve of {\textgreater}95{\%}. We conclude that incorporation of phenotype data can play a vital role in translational bioinformatics and propose that exome sequencing projects should systematically capture clinical phenotypes to take advantage of the strategy presented here.},

abstract = {Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, which identify genetic markers associated with the expression of a gene, are an important tool in the understanding of diseases in human and other populations. While most eQTL studies to date consider the connection between genetic variation and expression in a single tissue, complex, multi-tissue data sets are now being generated by the GTEx initiative. These data sets have the potential to improve the findings of single tissue analyses by borrowing strength across tissues, and the potential to elucidate the genotypic basis of differences between tissues. In this paper we introduce and study a multivariate hierarchical Bayesian model (MT-eQTL) for multi-tissue eQTL analysis. MT-eQTL directly models the vector of correlations between expression and genotype across tissues. It explicitly captures patterns of variation in the presence or absence of eQTLs, as well as the heterogeneity of effect sizes across tissues. Moreover, the model is applicable to complex designs in which the set of donors can (i) vary from tissue to tissue, and (ii) exhibit incomplete overlap between tissues. The MT-eQTL model is marginally consistent, in the sense that the model for a subset of tissues can be obtained from the full model via marginalization. Fitting of the MT-eQTL model is carried out via empirical Bayes, using an approximate EM algorithm. Inferences concerning eQTL detection and the configuration of eQTLs across tissues are derived from adaptive thresholding of local false discovery rates, and maximum a-posteriori estimation, respectively. We investigate the MT-eQTL model through a simulation study, and rigorously establish the FDR control of the local FDR testing procedure under mild assumptions appropriate for dependent data.},

abstract = {The use of codon substitution models to compare synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates is a widely used approach to detecting positive Darwinian selection affecting protein evolution. However, in several recent papers, Hughes and colleagues claim that codon-based likelihood-ratio tests (LRTs) are logically flawed as they lack prior hypotheses and fail to accommodate random fluctuations in synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions Friedman and Hughes (2007) also used site-based LRTs to analyze 605 gene families consisting of human and mouse paralogues. They found that the outcome of the tests was largely determined by irrelevant factors such as the GC content at the third codon positions and the synonymous rate d(S), but not by the nonsynonymous rate d(N) or the d(N)/d(S) ratio, factors that should be related to selection. Here, we reanalyze those data. Contra Friedman and Hughes, we found that the test results are related to sequence length and the average d(N)/d(S) ratio. We examine the criticisms of Hughes and suggest that they are based on misunderstandings of the codon models and on statistical errors. Our analyses suggest that codon-based tests are useful tools for comparative analysis of genomic data sets.},

abstract = {We describe a novel model and algorithm for simultaneously estimating multiple molecular sequence alignments and the phylogenetic trees that relate the sequences. Unlike current techniques that base phylogeny estimates on a single estimate of the alignment, we take alignment uncertainty into account by considering all possible alignments. Furthermore, because the alignment and phylogeny are constructed simultaneously, a guide tree is not needed. This sidesteps the problem in which alignments created by progressive alignment are biased toward the guide tree used to generate them. Joint estimation also allows us to model rate variation between sites when estimating the alignment and to use the evidence in shared insertion/deletions (indels) to group sister taxa in the phylogeny. Our indel model makes use of affine gap penalties and considers indels of multiple letters. We make the simplifying assumption that the indel process is identical on all branches. As a result, the probability of a gap is independent of branch length. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to sample from the posterior of the joint model, estimating the most probable alignment and tree and their support simultaneously. We describe a new MCMC transition kernel that improves our algorithm's mixing efficiency, allowing the MCMC chains to converge even when started from arbitrary alignments. Our software implementation can estimate alignment uncertainty and we describe a method for summarizing this uncertainty in a single plot.},

abstract = {CFTR is a member of the traffic ATPase superfamily and a Cl- ion channel that appears to require ATP hydrolysis for gating. Analysis of single CFTR Cl- channels reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers revealed the presence of two open conductance states that are connected to each other and to the closed state by an asymmetric cycle of gating events. We show here that the transition between the two open conductance states is directly coupled to ATP hydrolysis by one of the consensus nucleotide-binding folds, designated NBF2. Moreover, the transition between the closed state and one of the open states is linked to the binding of ATP. This analysis permits real-time visualization of conformational changes associated with a single cycle of ATP hydrolysis by a single protein molecule and suggests a model describing a role for ATP in CFTR gating.},

abstract = {The associative memory, water mediated, structure and energy model (AWSEM) is a coarse-grained protein force field. AWSEM contains physically motivated terms, such as hydrogen bonding, as well as a bioinformatically based local structure biasing term, which efficiently takes into account many-body effects that are modulated by the local sequence. When combined with appropriate local or global alignments to choose memories, AWSEM can be used to perform de novo protein structure prediction. Herein we present structure prediction results for a particular choice of local sequence alignment method based on short residue sequences called fragments. We demonstrate the model's structure prediction capabilities for three levels of global homology between the target sequence and those proteins used for local structure biasing, all of which assume that the structure of the target sequence is not known. When there are no homologues in the database of structures used for local structure biasing, AWSEM calculations produce structural predictions that are somewhat improved compared with prior works using related approaches. The inclusion of a small number of structures from homologous sequences improves structure prediction only marginally, but when the fragment search is restricted to only homologous sequences, AWSEM can perform high resolution structure prediction and can be used for kinetics and dynamics studies.},

Here, we analyze protein-ligand complexes and discuss methods that assist binding site identification, prediction of druggability and binding site comparison. The full potential of pockets is yet to be harnessed, and we envision that better understanding of the pocket space will have far-reaching implications in the field of drug discovery, such as the design of pocket-specific compound libraries and scoring functions. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Rodrigue2006,
abstract = {In recent works, methods have been proposed for applying phylogenetic models that allow for a general interdependence between the amino acid positions of a protein. As of yet, such models have focused on site interdependencies resulting from sequence-structure compatibility constraints, using simplified structural representations in combination with a set of statistical potentials. This structural compatibility criterion is meant as a proxy for sequence fitness, and the methods developed thus far can incorporate different site-interdependent fitness proxies based on other measurements. However, no methods have been proposed for comparing and evaluating the adequacy of alternative fitness proxies in this context, or for more general comparisons with canonical models of protein evolution. In the present work, we apply Bayesian methods of model selection-based on numerical calculations of marginal likelihoods and posterior predictive checks-to evaluate models encompassing the site-interdependent framework. Our application of these methods indicates that considering site-interdependencies, as done here, leads to an improved model fit for all data sets studied. Yet, we find that the use of pairwise contact potentials alone does not suitably account for across-site rate heterogeneity or amino acid exchange propensities; for such complexities, site-independent treatments are still called for. The most favored models combine the use of statistical potentials with a suitably rich site-independent model. Altogether, the methodology employed here should allow for a more rigorous and systematic exploration of different ways of modeling explicit structural constraints, or any other site-interdependent criterion, while best exploiting the richness of previously proposed models.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic DNA is organized into a macromolecular structure called chromatin. The basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of two copies of each of the four core histones and DNA. The nucleosomal organization and the positions of nucleosomes have profound effects on all DNA-dependent processes. Understanding the factors that influence nucleosome positioning is therefore of general interest. Among the many determinants of nucleosome positioning, the DNA sequence has been proposed to have a major role. Here, we analyzed more than 860,000 nucleosomal DNA sequences to identify sequence features that guide the formation of nucleosomes in vivo. We found that both a periodic enrichment of AT base pairs and an out-of-phase oscillating enrichment of GC base pairs as well as the overall preference for GC base pairs are determinants of nucleosome positioning. The preference for GC pairs can be related to a lower energetic cost required for deformation of the DNA to wrap around the histones. In line with this idea, we found that only incorporation of both signal components into a sequence model for nucleosome formation results in maximal predictive performance on a genome-wide scale. In this manner, one achieves greater predictive power than published approaches. Our results confirm the hypothesis that the DNA sequence has a major role in nucleosome positioning in vivo.},

We performed both exome sequencing of paired samples and analysis of de novo variants from whole-exome sequencing of 2,388 families. While we find little evidence for tissue-specific mosaic mutation, multi-tissue post-zygotic mutation (i.e. mosaicism) is frequent, with detectable mosaic variation comprising 5.4{\%} of all de novo mutations. We identify three mosaic missense and likely-gene disrupting mutations in genes previously implicated in ASD (KMT2C, NCKAP1, and MYH10) in probands but none in siblings. We find a strong ascertainment bias for mosaic mutations in probands relative to their unaffected siblings (p = 0.003). We build a model of de novo variation incorporating mosaic variants and errors in classification of mosaic status and from this model we estimate that 33{\%} of mosaic mutations in probands contribute to 5.1{\%} of simplex ASD diagnoses (95{\%} credible interval 1.3{\%} to 8.9{\%}). Our results indicate a contributory role for multi-tissue mosaic mutation in some individuals with an ASD diagnosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Replicators are the crucial entities in evolution. The notion of a replicator, however, is far less exact than the weight of its importance. Without identifying and classifying multiplying entities exactly, their dynamics cannot be determined appropriately. Therefore, it is importance to decide the nature and characteristics of any multiplying entity, in a detailed and formal way. RESULTS: Replication is basically an autocatalytic process which enables us to rest on the notions of formal chemistry. This statement has major implications. Simple autocatalytic cycle intermediates are considered as non-informational replicators. A consequence of which is that any autocatalytically multiplying entity is a replicator, be it simple or overly complex (even nests). A stricter definition refers to entities which can inherit acquired changes (informational replicators). Simple autocatalytic molecules (and nests) are excluded from this group. However, in turn, any entity possessing copiable information is to be named a replicator, even multicellular organisms. In order to deal with the situation, an abstract, formal framework is presented, which allows the proper identification of various types of replicators. This sheds light on the old problem of the units and levels of selection and evolution. A hierarchical classification for the partition of the replicator-continuum is provided where specific replicators are nested within more general ones. The classification should be able to be successfully applied to known replicators and also to future candidates. CONCLUSION: This paper redefines the concept of the replicator from a bottom-up theoretical approach. The formal definition and the abstract models presented can distinguish between among all possible replicator types, based on their quantity of variable and heritable information. This allows for the exact identification of various replicator types and their underlying dynamics. The most important claim is that replication, in general, is basically autocatalysis, with a specific defined environment and selective force. A replicator is not valid unless its working environment, and the selective force to which it is subject, is specified.},

On the basis of these findings, we developed a computational method for predicting miRNA targets that accounts for the presence of PRE in the proximity of seed-match sequences within poorly accessible structures. Moreover, we implement the miRNA-MRE duplex pairing as a two-step model, which better fits the available structural data. This algorithm, called MREdictor, allows for the identification of miRNA targets in poorly accessible regions and is not restricted to a perfect seed-match; these features are not present in other computational prediction methods.},

abstract = {Deciphering the biological networks underlying complex phenotypic traits, e.g., human disease is undoubtedly crucial to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and to develop effective therapeutics. Due to the network complexity and the relatively small number of available experiments, data-driven modeling is a great challenge for deducing the functions of genes/proteins in the network and in phenotype formation. We propose a novel knowledge-driven systems biology method that utilizes qualitative knowledge to construct a Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) to represent the biological network underlying a specific phenotype. Edges in this network depict physical interactions between genes and/or proteins. A qualitative knowledge model first translates typical molecular interactions into constraints when resolving the DBN structure and parameters. Therefore, the uncertainty of the network is restricted to a subset of models which are consistent with the qualitative knowledge. All models satisfying the constraints are considered as candidates for the underlying network. These consistent models are used to perform quantitative inference. By in silico inference, we can predict phenotypic traits upon genetic interventions and perturbing in the network. We applied our method to analyze the puzzling mechanism of breast cancer cell proliferation network and we accurately predicted cancer cell growth rate upon manipulating (anti)cancerous marker genes/proteins.},

abstract = {Association between disease and genetic polymorphisms often contributes critical information in our search for the genetic components of common diseases. Devlin and Roeder [1999: Biometrics 55:997-1004] introduced genomic control, a statistical method that overcomes a drawback to the use of population-based samples for tests of association, namely spurious associations induced by population structure. In essence, genomic control (GC) uses markers throughout the genome to adjust for any inflation in test statistics due to substructure. To date, genomic control (GC) has been developed for binary traits and bi- or multiallelic markers. Tests of association using GC have been limited to single genes. In this report, we generalize GC to quantitative traits (QT) and multilocus models. Using statistical analysis and simulations, we show that GC controls spurious associations in reasonable settings of population substructure for QT models, including gene-gene interaction. Through simulations, we explore GC power for both random and selected samples, assuming the QT locus tested is causal and its specific heritability is 2.5-5{\%}. We find that GC, combined with either random or selected samples, has good power in this setting, and that more complex models induce smaller GC corrections. The latter suggests greater power can be achieved by specifying more complex genetic models, but this observation only follows when such models are largely correct and specified a priori.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, an ancient family of proteins found in all phyla. In nearly all cases, ABC proteins are transporters that couple the hydrolysis of ATP to the transmembrane movement of substrate via an alternating access mechanism. In contrast, CFTR is best known for its activity as an ATP-dependent chloride channel. We asked why CFTR, which shares the domain architecture of ABC proteins that function as transporters, exhibits functional divergence. We compared CFTR protein sequences to those of other ABC transporters, which identified the ABCC4 proteins as the closest mammalian paralogs, and used statistical analysis of the CFTR-ABCC4 multiple sequence alignment to identify the specific domains and residues most likely to be involved in the evolutionary transition from transporter to channel activity. Among the residues identified as being involved in CFTR functional divergence, by virtue of being both CFTR-specific and conserved among all CFTR orthologs, was R352 in the sixth transmembrane helix (TM6). Patch-clamp experiments show that R352 interacts with D993 in TM9 to stabilize the open-channel state; D993 is absolutely conserved between CFTRs and ABCC4s. These data suggest that CFTR channel activity evolved, at least in part, by converting the conformational changes associated with binding and hydrolysis of ATP, as are found in true ABC Transporters, into an open permeation pathway by means of intraprotein interactions that stabilize the open state. This analysis sets the stage for understanding the evolutionary and functional relationships that make CFTR a unique ABC transporter protein.},

Moreover, the average number of neutral mutant neighbors per individual is given by the matrix spectral radius. These results quantify the extent to which populations evolve mutational robustness—the insensitivity of the phenotype to mutations—and thus reduce genetic load. Because the average neutrality is independent of evolutionary parameters—such as mutation rate, population size, and selective advantage—one can infer global statistics of neutral network topology by using simple population data available from or evolution. Populations evolving on neutral networks of RNA secondary structures show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {Likelihood-based approaches can reconstruct evolutionary processes in greater detail and with better precision from larger data sets. The extremely large comparative genomic data sets that are now being generated thus create new opportunities for understanding molecular evolution, but analysis of such large quantities of data poses escalating computational challenges. Recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that augment substitution histories are a promising approach to alleviate these computational costs. We analyzed the computational costs of several such approaches, considering how they scale with model and data set complexity. This provided a theoretical framework to understand the most important computational bottlenecks, leading us to combine novel variations of our conditional pathway integration approach with recent advances made by others. The resulting technique ("partial sampling" of substitution histories) is considerably faster than all other approaches we considered. It is accurate, simple to implement, and scales exceptionally well with dimensions of model complexity and data set size. In particular, the time complexity of sampling unobserved substitution histories using the new method is much faster than previously existing methods, and model parameter and branch length updates are independent of data set size. We compared the performance of methods on a 224-taxon set of mammalian cytochrome-b sequences. For a simple nucleotide substitution model, partial sampling was at least 10 times faster than the PhyloBayes program, which samples substitutions in continuous time, and about 100 times faster than when using fully integrated substitution histories. Under a general reversible model of amino acid substitution, the partial sampling method was 1,600 times faster than when using fully integrated substitution histories, confirming significantly improved scaling with model state-space complexity. Partial sampling of substitutions thus dramatically improves the utility of likelihood approaches for analyzing complex evolutionary processes on large data sets.},

abstract = {Computational genomics is now generating very large volumes of data that have the potential to be used to address important questions in both basic biology and biomedicine. Addressing these important biological questions becomes possible when mechanistic models rooted in biochemistry and evolutionary/population genetic processes are developed, instead of fitting data to off-the-shelf statistical distributions that do not enable mechanistic inference. Three examples are presented, the first involving ecological processes inferred from metagenomic data, the second involving mechanisms of gene regulation rooted in protein-DNA interactions with consideration of DNA structure, and the third involving existing models for the retention of duplicate genes that enables prediction of evolutionary mechanisms. This description of mechanistic models is generalized toward future developments in computational genomics and the need for biological mechanisms and processes in biological models.},

Here, we describe a phylogeny of COBRA methods that has rapidly evolved from the few early methods, such as flux balance analysis and elementary flux mode analysis, into a repertoire of more than 100 methods.

Current efforts in interdisciplinary protein modeling are in their infancy and the state-of-the art of such models is described. Beyond the relationship between amino acid substitution and static protein structure, protein function, and corresponding organismal fitness, other considerations are also discussed. More complex mutational processes such as insertion and deletion and domain rearrangements and even circular permutations should be evaluated. The role of intrinsically disordered proteins is still controversial, but may be increasingly important to consider. Protein geometry and protein dynamics as a deviation from static considerations of protein structure are also important. Protein expression level is known to be a major determinant of evolutionary rate and several considerations including selection at the mRNA level and the role of interaction specificity are discussed. Lastly, the relationship between modeling and needed high-throughput experimental data as well as experimental examination of protein evolution using ancestral sequence resurrection and in vitro biochemistry are presented, towards an aim of ultimately generating better models for biological inference and prediction.},

In genome sequences from proliferating cells, read depth along chromosomes reflected DNA replication activity in those cells. We used this relationship to analyze variation in replication timing among 161 individuals sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project. Genome-wide association of replication timing with genetic variation identified 16 loci at which inherited alleles associate with replication timing. We call these "replication timing quantitative trait loci" (rtQTLs). rtQTLs involved the differential use of replication origins, exhibited allele-specific effects on replication timing, and associated with gene expression variation at megabase scales. Our results show replication timing to be shaped by genetic polymorphism and identify a means by which inherited polymorphism regulates the mutability of nearby sequences.},

abstract = {We describe a new approach to explore and quantify the sequence space associated with a given protein structure. A set of sequences are optimized for a given target structure, using all-atom models and a physical energy function. Specificity of the sequence for its target is ensured by using the random energy model, which keeps the amino acid composition of the sequence constant. The designed sequences provide a multiple sequence alignment that describes the sequence space compatible with the structure of interest; here the size of this space is estimated by using an information entropy measure. In parallel, multiple alignments of naturally occurring sequences can be derived by using either sequence or structure alignments. We compared these 3 independent multiple sequence alignments for 10 different proteins, ranging in size from 56 to 310 residues. We observed that the subset of the sequence space derived by using our design procedure is similar in size to the sequence spaces observed in nature. These results suggest that the volume of sequence space compatible with a given protein fold is defined by the length of the protein as well as by the topology (i.e., geometry of the polypeptide chain) and the stability (i.e., free energy of denaturation) of the fold.},

Maximum likelihood models of codon substitution developed recently account for variable selective pressures among amino acid sites by employing a statistical distribution for the {\{}omega{\}} ratio among sites. Those models, called random-sites models, are suitable when we do not know a priori which sites are under what kind of selective pressure. Sometimes prior information (such as the tertiary structure of the protein) might be available to partition sites in the protein into different classes, which are expected to be under different selective pressures. It is then sensible to use such information in the model. In this paper, we implement maximum likelihood models for prepartitioned data sets, which account for the heterogeneity among site partitions by using different{\{}omega{\}} parameters for the partitions. The models, referred to as fixed-sites models, are also useful for combined analysis of multiple genes from the same set of species. We apply the models to data sets of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles from human populations and of the abalone sperm lysin genes. Structural information is used to partition sites in MHC into two classes: those in the antigen recognition site (ARS) and those outside. Positive selection is detected in the ARS by the fixed-sites models. Similarly, sites in lysin are classified into the buried and solvent-exposed classes according to the tertiary structure, and positive selection was detected at the solvent-exposed sites. The random-sites models identified a number of sites under positive selection in each data set, confirming and elaborating the results of the fixed-sites models. The analysis demonstrates the utility of the fixed-sites models, as well as the power of previous random-sites models, which do not use the prior information to partition sites.},

abstract = {The mechanism of intra-protein communication and allosteric coupling is key to understanding the structure-property relationship of protein function. For subtilisin Carlsberg, the Ca(2+)-binding loop is distal to substrate-binding and active sites, yet the serine protease function depends on Ca(2+) binding. The atomic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of apo and Ca(2+)-bound subtilisin show similar structures and there is no direct evidence that subtilisin has alternative conformations. To model the intra-protein communication due to Ca(2+) binding, we transform the sequential segments of an atomic MD trajectory into separate elastic network models to represent anharmonicity and nonlinearity effectively as the temporal and spatial variation of the mechanical coupling network. In analogy to the spectrogram of sound waves, this transformation is termed the "fluctuogram" of protein dynamics. We illustrate that the Ca(2+)-bound and apo states of subtilisin have different fluctuograms and that intra-protein communication proceeds intermittently both in space and in time. We found that residues with large mechanical coupling variation due to Ca(2+) binding correlate with the reported mutation sites selected by directed evolution for improving the stability of subtilisin and its activity in a non-aqueous environment. Furthermore, we utilize the fluctuograms calculated from MD to capture the highly correlated residues in a multiple sequence alignment. We show that in addition to the magnitude, the variance of coupling strength is also an indicative property for the sequence correlation observed in a statistical coupling analysis. The results of this work illustrate that the mechanical coupling networks calculated from atomic details can be used to correlate with functionally important mutation sites and co-evolution.},

abstract = {Gene duplication has generally been viewed as a necessary source of material for the origin of evolutionary novelties, but it is unclear how often gene duplicates arise and how frequently they evolve new functions. Observations from the genomic databases for several eukaryotic species suggest that duplicate genes arise at a very high rate, on average 0.01 per gene per million years. Most duplicated genes experience a brief period of relaxed selection early in their history, with a moderate fraction of them evolving in an effectively neutral manner during this period. However, the vast majority of gene duplicates are silenced within a few million years, with the few survivors subsequently experiencing strong purifying selection. Although duplicate genes may only rarely evolve new functions, the stochastic silencing of such genes may play a significant role in the passive origin of new species.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Converting the vast quantity of free-format text found in journals into a concise, structured format makes the researcher's quest for information easier. Recently, several information extraction systems have been developed that attempt to simplify the retrieval and analysis of biological and medical data. Most of this work has used the abstract alone, owing to the convenience of access and the quality of data. Abstracts are generally available through central collections with easy direct access (e.g. PubMed). The full-text papers contain more information, but are distributed across many locations (e.g. publishers' web sites, journal web sites and local repositories), making access more difficult. In this paper, we present BioRAT, a new information extraction (IE) tool, specifically designed to perform biomedical IE, and which is able to locate and analyse both abstracts and full-length papers. BioRAT is a Biological Research Assistant for Text mining, and incorporates a document search ability with domain-specific IE. RESULTS: We show first, that BioRAT performs as well as existing systems, when applied to abstracts; and second, that significantly more information is available to BioRAT through the full-length papers than via the abstracts alone. Typically, less than half of the available information is extracted from the abstract, with the majority coming from the body of each paper. Overall, BioRAT recalled 20.31{\%} of the target facts from the abstracts with 55.07{\%} precision, and achieved 43.6{\%} recall with 51.25{\%} precision on full-length papers.},

@article{Jaynes1968,
abstract = {In decision theory, mathematical analysis shows that once the sampling distribution, loss function, and sample are specified, the only remaining basis for a choice among different admissible decisions lies in the prior probabilities. Therefore, the logical foundations of decision theory cannot be put in fully satisfactory form until the old problem of arbitrariness (sometimes called "subjectiveness") in assigning prior probabilities is resolved. The principle of maximum entropy represents one step in this direction. Its use is illustrated, and a correspondence property between maximum-entropy probabilities and frequencies is demonstrated. The consistency of this principle with the principles of conventional "direct probability" analysis is illustrated by showing that many known results may be derived by either method. However, an ambiguity remains in setting up a prior on a continuous parameter space because the results lack invariance under a change of parameters; thus a further principle is needed. It is shown that in many problems, including some of the most important in practice, this ambiguity can be removed by applying methods of group theoretical reasoning which have long been used in theoretical physics. By finding the group of transformations on the parameter space which convert the problem into an equivalent one, a basic desideratum of consistency can be stated in the form of functional equations which impose conditions on, and in some cases fully determine, an "invariant measure" on the parameter space.},

This approach has been validated by generating models for 28 membrane proteins with a diverse range of complex topologies and an average length of over 300 residues with results showing that TM-scores {\textgreater} 0.5 can be achieved in almost every case following refinement using MODELLER. In one of the most impressive results, a model of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase polypeptide I was obtained with a TM-score {\textgreater} 0.75 and an rmsd of only 5.7 Å over all 514 residues. These results suggest that FILM3 could be applicable to a wide range of transmembrane proteins of as-yet-unknown 3D structure given sufficient homologous sequences.},

@article{Neher:2001,
abstract = {The deconvolution method has been used in the past to estimate release rates of synaptic vesicles, but it cannot be applied to synapses where nonlinear interactions of quanta occur. We have extended this method to take into account a nonlinear current component resulting from the delayed clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft. We applied it to the calyx of Held and verified the important assumption of constant miniature EPSC (mEPSC) size by combining deconvolution with a variant of nonstationary fluctuation analysis. We found that amplitudes of mEPSCs decreased strongly after extended synaptic activity. Cyclothiazide (CTZ), an inhibitor of glutamate receptor desensitization, eliminated this reduction, suggesting that postsynaptic receptor desensitization occurs during strong synaptic activity at the calyx of Held. Constant mEPSC sizes could be obtained in the presence of CTZ and kynurenic acid (Kyn), a low-affinity blocker of AMPA-receptor channels. CTZ and Kyn prevented postsynaptic receptor desensitization and saturation and also minimized voltage-clamp errors. Therefore, we conclude that in the presence of these drugs, release rates at the calyx of Held can be reliably estimated over a wide range of conditions. Moreover, the method presented should provide a convenient way to study the kinetics of transmitter release at other synapses.},

We discovered abundant (12 to 24{\%}) monoallelic expression of autosomal genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation of the paternal X chromosome. We conclude that independent and stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random monoallelic expression in the mammalian cell.},

One of its most prominent applications is the sequencing of whole genomes or targeted regions of the genome such as all exonic regions (i.e., the exome). Here, the objective is the identification of genetic variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The extraction of SNPs from the raw genetic sequences involves many processing steps and the application of a diverse set of tools. We review the essential building blocks for a pipeline that calls SNPs from raw HTS data. The pipeline includes quality control, mapping of short reads to the reference genome, visualization and post-processing of the alignment including base quality recalibration. The final steps of the pipeline include the SNP calling procedure along with filtering of SNP candidates. The steps of this pipeline are accompanied by an analysis of a publicly available whole-exome sequencing dataset. To this end, we employ several alignment programs and SNP calling routines for highlighting the fact that the choice of the tools significantly affects the final results.},

To answer this challenge, we develop probabilistic graphical models of the biological system. We offer three such models and algorithms to automat- ically learn these from gene expression data.

However, NGS-based variant detection is still prone to errors, resulting in inaccurate variant calls. Here, we categorized the variants detected by NGS according to total read depth (TD) and SNP quality (SNPQ), and performed Sanger sequencing with 348 selected non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) for validation. Using the SAMtools and GATK algorithms, the validation rate was positively correlated with SNPQ but showed no correlation with TD. In addition, common variants called by both programs had a higher validation rate than caller-specific variants. We further examined several parameters to improve the validation rate, and found that strand bias (SB) was a key parameter. SB in NGS data showed a strong difference between the variants passing validation and those that failed validation, showing a validation rate of more than 92{\%} (filtering cutoff value: alternate allele forward [AF] ≥ 20 and AF{\textless}80 in SAMtools, SB{\textless}-10 in GATK). Moreover, the validation rate increased significantly (up to 97-99{\%}) when the variant was filtered together with the suggested values of mapping quality (MQ), SNPQ and SB. This detailed and systematic study provides comprehensive recommendations for improving validation rates, saving time and lowering cost in NGS analyses.},

Through an integrative network-based approach, we rank-ordered these network structures for relevance to LOAD pathology, highlighting an immune- and microglia-specific module that is dominated by genes involved in pathogen phagocytosis, contains TYROBP as a key regulator, and is upregulated in LOAD. Mouse microglia cells overexpressing intact or truncated TYROBP revealed expression changes that significantly overlapped the human brain TYROBP network. Thus the causal network structure is a useful predictor of response to gene perturbations and presents a framework to test models of disease mechanisms underlying LOAD. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Recently, microRNAs (miRNA), small noncoding RNAs, have taken center stage in the field of human molecular oncology. However, their roles in tumor biology remain largely unknown. According to the assumption that miRNAs implicated in a specific tumor phenotype will show aberrant regulation of their target genes, we introduce an approach based on the miRNA target-dysregulated network (MTDN) to prioritize novel disease miRNAs. Target genes have predicted binding sites for any miRNA. The MTDN is constructed by combining computational target prediction with miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in tumor and nontumor tissues. Application of the proposed method to prostate cancer reveals that known prostate cancer miRNAs are characterized by a greater number of dysregulations and coregulators and the tendency to coregulate with each other and that they share a higher proportion of targets with other prostate cancer miRNAs. Support vector machine classifier, based on these features and changes in miRNA expression, is constructed and gives an average overall prediction accuracy of 0.8872 in cross-validation tests. The classifier is then applied to miRNAs in the MTDN. Functions enriched by dysregulated targets of novel predicted miRNAs are closely associated with oncogenesis. In addition, predicted cancer miRNAs within families or from different families show combinatorial dysregulation of target genes, as revealed by analysis of the MTDN modular organization. Finally, 3 miRNA target regulations are verified to hold in prostate cancer cells by transfection assays. These results show that the network-centric method could prioritize novel disease miRNAs and model how oncogenic lesions are mediated by miRNAs, providing important insights into tumorigenesis.},

Although high-coverage sequencing can uncover most variants present in the sequenced sample, low-coverage sequencing is appealing for its cost effectiveness. Here, we present AbCD (arbitrary coverage design) to aid the design of sequencing-based studies. AbCD is a user-friendly interface providing pre-estimated effective sample sizes, specific to each minor allele frequency category, for designs with arbitrary coverage (0.5-30×) and sample size (20-10 000), and for four major ethnic groups (Europeans, Africans, Asians and African Americans). In addition, we also present two software tools: ShotGun and DesignPlanner, which were used to generate the estimates behind AbCD. ShotGun is a flexible short-read simulator for arbitrary user-specified read length and average depth, allowing cycle-specific sequencing error rates and realistic read depth distributions. DesignPlanner is a full pipeline that uses ShotGun to generate sequence data and performs initial SNP discovery, uses our previously presented linkage disequilibrium-aware method to call genotypes, and, finally, provides minor allele frequency-specific effective sample sizes. ShotGun plus DesignPlanner can accommodate effective sample size estimate for any combination of high-depth and low-depth data (for example, whole-genome low-depth plus exonic high-depth) or combination of sequence and genotype data [for example, whole-exome sequencing plus genotyping from existing Genomewide Association Study (GWAS)].},

@article{Yeang:2007,
abstract = {A probabilistic graphical model is proposed in order to detect the coevolution between different sites in biological sequences. The model extends the continuous-time Markov process of sequence substitution for single nucleic or amino acids and imposes general constraints regarding simultaneous changes on the substitution rate matrix. Given a multiple sequence alignment for each molecule of interest and a phylogenetic tree, the model can predict potential interactions within or between nucleic acids and proteins. Initial validation of the model is carried out using tRNA and 16S rRNA sequence data. The model accurately identifies the secondary interactions of tRNA as well as several known tertiary interactions. In addition, results on 16S rRNA data indicate this general and simple coevolutionary model outperforms several other parametric and nonparametric methods in predicting secondary interactions. Furthermore, the majority of the putative predictions exhibit either direct contact or proximity of the nucleotide pairs in the 3-dimensional structure of the Thermus thermophilus ribosomal small subunit. The results on RNA data suggest a general model of coevolution might be applied to other types of interactions between protein, DNA, and RNA molecules.},

abstract = {Detecting, characterizing, and interpreting gene-gene interactions or epistasis in studies of human disease susceptibility is both a mathematical and a computational challenge. To address this problem, we have previously developed a multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method for collapsing high-dimensional genetic data into a single dimension (i.e. constructive induction) thus permitting interactions to be detected in relatively small sample sizes. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive and flexible framework for detecting and interpreting gene-gene interactions that utilizes advances in information theory for selecting interesting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), MDR for constructive induction, machine learning methods for classification, and finally graphical models for interpretation. We illustrate the usefulness of this strategy using artificial datasets simulated from several different two-locus and three-locus epistasis models. We show that the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of a na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifier are significantly improved when SNPs are selected based on their information gain (i.e. class entropy removed) and reduced to a single attribute using MDR. We then apply this strategy to detecting, characterizing, and interpreting epistatic models in a genetic study (n = 5 0 0) of atrial fibrillation and show that both classification and model interpretation are significantly improved. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Zhu2007,
abstract = {To dissect common human diseases such as obesity and diabetes, a systematic approach is needed to study how genes interact with one another, and with genetic and environmental factors, to determine clinical end points or disease phenotypes. Bayesian networks provide a convenient framework for extracting relationships from noisy data and are frequently applied to large-scale data to derive causal relationships among variables of interest. Given the complexity of molecular networks underlying common human disease traits, and the fact that biological networks can change depending on environmental conditions and genetic factors, large datasets, generally involving multiple perturbations (experiments), are required to reconstruct and reliably extract information from these networks. With limited resources, the balance of coverage of multiple perturbations and multiple subjects in a single perturbation needs to be considered in the experimental design. Increasing the number of experiments, or the number of subjects in an experiment, is an expensive and time-consuming way to improve network reconstruction. Integrating multiple types of data from existing subjects might be more efficient. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that combining genotypic and gene expression data in a segregating population leads to improved network reconstruction, which in turn may lead to better predictions of the effects of experimental perturbations on any given gene. Here we simulate data based on networks reconstructed from biological data collected in a segregating mouse population and quantify the improvement in network reconstruction achieved using genotypic and gene expression data, compared with reconstruction using gene expression data alone. We demonstrate that networks reconstructed using the combined genotypic and gene expression data achieve a level of reconstruction accuracy that exceeds networks reconstructed from expression data alone, and that fewer subjects may be required to achieve this superior reconstruction accuracy. We conclude that this integrative genomics approach to reconstructing networks not only leads to more predictive network models, but also may save time and money by decreasing the amount of data that must be generated under any given condition of interest to construct predictive network models.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNA) regulate many genes critical for tumorigenesis. We profiled miRNAs from 11 normal breast tissues, 17 noninvasive, 151 invasive breast carcinomas, and 6 cell lines by in-house-developed barcoded Solexa sequencing. miRNAs were organized in genomic clusters representing promoter-controlled miRNA expression and sequence families representing seed sequence-dependent miRNA target regulation. Unsupervised clustering of samples by miRNA sequence families best reflected the clustering based on mRNA expression available for this sample set. Clustering and comparative analysis of miRNA read frequencies showed that normal breast samples were separated from most noninvasive ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinomas by increased miR-21 (the most abundant miRNA in carcinomas) and multiple decreased miRNA families (including miR-98/let-7), with most miRNA changes apparent already in the noninvasive carcinomas. In addition, patients that went on to develop metastasis showed increased expression of mir-423, and triple-negative breast carcinomas were most distinct from other tumor subtypes due to upregulation of the mir{\~{}}17-92 cluster. However, absolute miRNA levels between normal breast and carcinomas did not reveal any significant differences. We also discovered two polymorphic nucleotide variations among the more abundant miRNAs miR-181a (T19G) and miR-185 (T16G), but we did not identify nucleotide variations expected for classical tumor suppressor function associated with miRNAs. The differentiation of tumor subtypes and prediction of metastasis based on miRNA levels is statistically possible but is not driven by deregulation of abundant miRNAs, implicating far fewer miRNAs in tumorigenic processes than previously suggested.},

More precisely the resulting representation space is a complete topological vector space equipped with a non-degenerate indefinite Hermitian scalar product and as a vector space admits a family of corresponding direct sum decompositions into orthogonal pairs of maximal definite Hilbert subspaces. It is observed that the associated "net of algebras of local quantum observables" on this representation space in the sense of algebraic quantum field theory contains curvature tensors. Classical vacuum gravitational fields i.e., Einstein manifolds correspond to quantum observables obeying at least one of the above decompositions of the space. General local quantum observables of this theory are also investigated.   In this way classical general relativity exactly in 4 dimensions naturally embeds into an algebraic quantum field theory possessing a diffeomorphism group symmetry and this theory is constructed out of the structures provided by an oriented 4-manifold only.},

Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition is known to create mosaicism by inserting L1 sequences into new locations of somatic cell genomes. Using a machine learning-based, single-cell sequencing approach, we discovered that somatic L1-associated variants (SLAVs) are composed of two classes: L1 retrotransposition insertions and retrotransposition-independent L1-associated variants. We demonstrate that a subset of SLAVs comprises somatic deletions generated by L1 endonuclease cutting activity. Retrotransposition-independent rearrangements in inherited L1s resulted in the deletion of proximal genomic regions. These rearrangements were resolved by microhomology-mediated repair, which suggests that L1-associated genomic regions are hotspots for somatic copy number variants in the brain and therefore a heritable genetic contributor to somatic mosaicism. We demonstrate that SLAVs are present in crucial neural genes, such as DLG2 (also called PSD93), and affect 44-63{\%} of cells of the cells in the healthy brain.},

abstract = {Genetic variants in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting regulators frequently influence the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription. Recent interest in expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping has paralleled the adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the analysis of complex traits and disease in humans. Under the hypothesis that many GWAS associations tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and that these SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression, it has become common to interpret GWAS associations using eQTL data. To fully exploit the mechanistic interpretability of eQTL-GWAS comparisons, an improved understanding of the genetic architecture and causal mechanisms of cell type specificity of eQTLs is required. We address this need by performing an eQTL analysis in three parts: first we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; then we integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project; finally we built a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. The cell type specificity of eQTLs is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs. We then demonstrate that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. We anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.},

Because of the algorithm's efficiency on many microcomputers, sensitive protein database searches may now become a routine procedure for molecular biologists. The method efficiently identifies regions of similar sequence and then scores the aligned identical and differing residues in those regions by means of an amino acid replacability matrix.

The algorithm has been implemented in a computer program designed to search protein databases very rapidly. For example, comparison of a 200-amino-acid sequence to the 500,000 residues in the National Biomedical Research Foundation library would take less than 2 minutes on a minicomputer, and less than 10 minutes on a microcomputer (IBM PC).},

abstract = {A method is presented for rapidly extracting single-channel transition rate constants from patch-clamp recordings containing signals from several channels. The procedure is based on a simultaneous fit of the observed dwell-time distributions for all conductance levels, using a maximum likelihood approach. This algorithm allows estimation of single-channel rate constants in cases where more advanced methods may be impractical because of their extremely long computational time. A correction is included for the limited time resolution of the recording system, according to theory developed by Roux and Sauv{\{}{\'{e}}{\}} (Biophys. J. 48:149-158, 1985), by accounting for the impact of undetected transitions on the dwell-time distributions, and by introducing an improved practical implementation of a fixed dead time for the case of more than one channel. This feature allows application of the method to noisy data, after filtering. A computer program implementing the method is tested successfully on a variety of simulated multichannel current traces.},

abstract = {Secretory vesicles dock at their target in preparation for fusion. Using single-vesicle total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in chromaffin cells, we show that most approaching vesicles dock only transiently, but that some are captured by at least two different tethering modes, weak and strong. Both vesicle delivery and tethering depend on Munc18-1, a known docking factor. By decreasing the amount of cortical actin by Latrunculin A application, morphological docking can be restored artificially in docking-deficient munc18-1 null cells, but neither strong tethering nor fusion, demonstrating that morphological docking is not sufficient for secretion. Deletion of the t-SNARE and Munc18-1 binding partner syntaxin, but not the v-SNARE synaptobrevin/VAMP, also reduces strong tethering and fusion. We conclude that docking vesicles either undock immediately or are captured by minimal tethering machinery and converted in a munc18-1/syntaxin-dependent, strongly tethered, fusion-competent state.},

abstract = {Over time, natural selection molds every gene into a unique mosaic of sites evolving rapidly or resisting change-an "evolutionary fingerprint" of the gene. Aspects of this evolutionary fingerprint, such as the site-specific ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS), are commonly used to identify genetic features of potential biological interest; however, no framework exists for comparing evolutionary fingerprints between genes. We hypothesize that protein-coding genes with similar protein structure and/or function tend to have similar evolutionary fingerprints and that comparing evolutionary fingerprints can be useful for discovering similarities between genes in a way that is analogous to, but independent of, discovery of similarity via sequence-based comparison tools such as Blast. To test this hypothesis, we develop a novel model of coding sequence evolution that uses a general bivariate discrete parameterization of the evolutionary rates. We show that this approach provides a better fit to the data using a smaller number of parameters than existing models. Next, we use the model to represent evolutionary fingerprints as probability distributions and present a methodology for comparing these distributions in a way that is robust against variations in data set size and divergence. Finally, using sequences of three rapidly evolving RNA viruses (HIV-1, hepatitis C virus, and influenza A virus), we demonstrate that genes within the same functional group tend to have similar evolutionary fingerprints. Our framework provides a sound statistical foundation for efficient inference and comparison of evolutionary rate patterns in arbitrary collections of gene alignments, clustering homologous and nonhomologous genes, and investigation of biological and functional correlates of evolutionary rates.},

abstract = {GWAS have emerged as popular tools for identifying genetic variants that are associated with disease risk. Standard analysis of??a case-control GWAS involves assessing the association between each individual genotyped SNP and disease risk. However, this approach suffers from limited reproducibility and difficulties in detecting multi-SNP and epistatic effects. As an alternative analytical strategy, we propose grouping SNPs together into SNP sets on the basis of proximity to genomic features such as genes or haplotype blocks, then testing the joint effect of each SNP set. Testing of each SNP set proceeds via the logistic kernel-machine-based test, which is based on a statistical framework that allows for flexible modeling of epistatic and nonlinear SNP effects. This flexibility and the ability to naturally adjust for covariate effects are important features of our test that make it appealing in comparison to individual SNP tests and existing multimarker tests. Using simulated data based on the International HapMap Project, we show that SNP-set testing can have improved power over standard individual-SNP analysis under a wide range of settings. In particular, we find that our approach has higher power than individual-SNP analysis when the median correlation between the disease-susceptibility variant and the genotyped SNPs is moderate to high. When the correlation is low, both individual-SNP analysis and the SNP-set analysis tend to have low power. We apply SNP-set analysis to analyze the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) breast cancer GWAS discovery-phase data. ?? 2010 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The analysis of co-evolving residues has been exhaustively evaluated for the prediction of intramolecular amino acid contacts in soluble proteins. Although a variety of different methods for the detection of these co-evolving residues have been developed, the fraction of correctly predicted contacts remained insufficient for their reliable application in the construction of structural models. Membrane proteins, which constitute between one-fourth and one-third of all proteins in an organism, were only considered in few individual case studies. RESULTS: We present the first general study of correlated mutations in alpha-helical membrane proteins. Using seven different prediction algorithms, we extracted co-evolving residues for 14 membrane proteins having a solved 3D structure. On average, distances between correlated pairs of residues lying on different transmembrane segments were found to be significantly smaller compared to a random prediction. Covariation of residues was frequently found in direct sequence neighborhood to helix-helix contacts. Based on the results obtained from individual prediction methods, we constructed a consensus prediction for every protein in the dataset that combines obtained correlations from different prediction algorithms and simultaneously removes likely false positives. Using this consensus prediction, 53{\%} of all predicted residue pairs were found within one helix turn of an observed helix-helix contact. Based on the combination of co-evolving residues detected with the four best prediction algorithms, interacting helices could be predicted with a specificity of 83{\%} and sensitivity of 42{\%}.

There are by now several algorithms developed for each of the four broad methods for CNV detection using NGS, namely the depth of coverage (DOC), read-pair, split-read and assembly-based methods. However, because of the complexity of the genome and the short read lengths from NGS technology, there are still many challenges associated with the analysis of NGS data for CNVs, no matter which method or algorithm is used. RESULTS In this review, we describe and discuss areas of potential biases in CNV detection for each of the four methods. In particular, we focus on issues pertaining to (i) mappability, (ii) GC-content bias, (iii) quality control measures of reads and (iv) difficulty in identifying duplications. To gain insights to some of the issues discussed, we also download real data from the 1000 Genomes Project and analyse its DOC data. We show examples of how reads in repeated regions can affect CNV detection, demonstrate current GC-correction algorithms, investigate sensitivity of DOC algorithm before and after quality control of reads and discuss reasons for which duplications are harder to detect than deletions.},

abstract = {Biophysical properties of the Ca(2+)-activated nonselective cation channel expressed in brain capillaries were studied in inside-out patches from primary cultures of rat brain microvascular endothelial cells. At -40 mV membrane potential, open probability (P(o)) was activated by cytosolic [Ca(2+)] {\textgreater} 1 micro M and was half-maximal at approximately 20 micro M. Increasing [Ca(2+)] stimulated opening rate with little effect on closing rate. At constant [Ca(2+)], P(o) was voltage-dependent, and effective gating charge corresponded to 0.6 +/- 0.1 unitary charges. Depolarization accelerated opening and slowed closing, thereby increasing apparent affinity for Ca(2+). Within approximately 1 min of excision, P(o) declined to a lower steady state with decreased sensitivity toward activating Ca(2+) when studied at a fixed voltage, and toward activating voltage when studied at a fixed [Ca(2+)]. Deactivated channels opened approximately 5-fold slower and closed approximately 10-fold faster. The sulfhydryl-reducing agent dithiotreitol (1 mM) completely reversed acceleration of closing rate but failed to recover opening rate. Single-channel gating was complex; distributions of open and closed dwell times contained at least four and five exponential components, respectively. The longest component of the closed-time distribution was markedly sensitive to both [Ca(2+)] and voltage. We conclude that the biophysical properties of gating of this channel are remarkably similar to those of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels.},

Ca(2+) sensors are thought to prevent spontaneous fusion at rest (clamping) and to promote fusion upon Ca(2+) activation. At least eight, often coexpressed, Ca(2+) sensors have been identified in mammals. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple Ca(2+) sensors interact, rather than work autonomously, to produce the complex secretory response observed in neurons and secretory cells. In this review, we present several working models to describe how different sensors might be arranged to mediate synchronous, asynchronous and spontaneous neurotransmitter release. We discuss the scenario that different Ca(2+) sensors typically act on one shared vesicle pool and compete for binding the multiple SNARE complexes that are likely to assemble at single vesicles, to exert both clamping and fusion-promoting functions.},

The design process of a discovery project remains formidable, being limited to ad hoc mixtures of extensive computer simulation and pilot sequencing. Here, the task is examined from a general mathematical perspective. RESULTS We pose and solve the population sequencing design problem and subsequently apply standard optimization techniques that maximize the discovery probability. Emphasis is placed on cases whose discovery thresholds place them within reach of current technologies. We find that parameter values characteristic of rare-variant projects lead to a general, yet remarkably simple set of optimization rules. Specifically, optimal processing occurs at constant values of the per-sample redundancy, refuting current notions that sample size should be selected outright. Optimal project-wide redundancy and sample size are then shown to be inversely proportional to the desired variant frequency. A second family of constants governs these relationships, permitting one to immediately establish the most efficient settings for a given set of discovery conditions. Our results largely concur with the empirical design of the Thousand Genomes Project, though they furnish some additional refinement. CONCLUSION The optimization principles reported here dramatically simplify the design process and should be broadly useful as rare-variant projects become both more important and routine in the future.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The detection of rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) is important for understanding genetic heterogeneity using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Various computational algorithms have been proposed to detect variants at the single nucleotide level in mixed samples. Yet, the noise inherent in the biological processes involved in NGS technology necessitates the development of statistically accurate methods to identify true rare variants. RESULTS We propose a Bayesian statistical model and a variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate non-reference allele frequency (NRAF) and identify SNVs in heterogeneous cell populations. We demonstrate that our variational EM algorithm has comparable sensitivity and specificity compared with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling inference algorithm, and is more computationally efficient on tests of relatively low coverage (27× and 298×) data. Furthermore, we show that our model with a variational EM inference algorithm has higher specificity than many state-of-the-art algorithms. In an analysis of a directed evolution longitudinal yeast data set, we are able to identify a time-series trend in non-reference allele frequency and detect novel variants that have not yet been reported. Our model also detects the emergence of a beneficial variant earlier than was previously shown, and a pair of concomitant variants. CONCLUSIONS We developed a variational EM algorithm for a hierarchical Bayesian model to identify rare variants in heterogeneous next-generation sequencing data. Our algorithm is able to identify variants in a broad range of read depths and non-reference allele frequencies with high sensitivity and specificity.},

abstract = {Folds are the basic building blocks of protein structures. Understanding the emergence of novel protein folds is an important step towards understanding the rules governing the evolution of protein structure and function and for developing tools for protein structure modeling and design. We explored the frequency of occurrences of an exhaustively classified library of supersecondary structural elements (Smotifs), in protein structures, in order to identify features that would define a fold as novel compared to previously known structures. We found that a surprisingly small set of Smotifs is sufficient to describe all known folds. Furthermore, novel folds do not require novel Smotifs, but rather are a new combination of existing ones. Novel folds can be typified by the inclusion of a relatively higher number of rarely occurring Smotifs in their structures and, to a lesser extent, by a novel topological combination of commonly occurring Smotifs. When investigating the structural features of Smotifs, we found that the top 10{\%} of most frequent ones have a higher fraction of internal contacts, while some of the most rare motifs are larger, and contain a longer loop region.},

abstract = {The remarkable conservation of protein structure, compared with that of sequences, suggests that in the course of evolution, residue substitutions which tend to destabilize a particular structure must be compensated by other substitutions that confer greater stability on that structure. Several approaches have been designed to detect correlated changes in a set of homologous sequences. However, most of them do not take into account the phylogeny of the sequences, and it has been shown that their detection power is weak. It remains unclear whether coevolution could be a general process at the level of amino acids of proteins. In the present study, we analyze the phylogenetic reconstruction of 15 sets of homologous proteins to assess, under different conditions, whether a significant amount of coevolving sites can be detected. Two criteria are used to detect significantly cosubstituting sites. One criterion corresponds to that of Shindyalov, Kolchanov, and Sander. The second one is based on intensive simulations of evolution of protein sequences along a phylogeny to estimate the significance of the number of observed cosubstitutions for pairs of sites. Our results show an important sensitivity of the detection of cosubstituting sites to the model used for the phylogenetic reconstruction. Not considering the uncertainty associated with the reconstructed data might lead to detecting numerous false-positive pairs of sites. Finally, significant amounts of coevolving pairs could be found only when substitutions affecting the physicochemical properties of the amino acids were considered. Such results suggest evidence of a cosubstitution mechanism in protein evolution. However, the identification of nonambiguous coevolving sites is still unresolved.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of psychiatric disorders have identified multiple genetic associations with such disorders, but better methods are needed to derive the underlying biological mechanisms that these signals indicate. We sought to identify biological pathways in GWAS data from over 60,000 participants from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. We developed an analysis framework to rank pathways that requires only summary statistics. We combined this score across disorders to find common pathways across three adult psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. Histone methylation processes showed the strongest association, and we also found statistically significant evidence for associations with multiple immune and neuronal signaling pathways and with the postsynaptic density. Our study indicates that risk variants for psychiatric disorders aggregate in particular biological pathways and that these pathways are frequently shared between disorders. Our results confirm known mechanisms and suggest several novel insights into the etiology of psychiatric disorders.},

We confirm that at least 5.5{\%} of the human genome has undergone purifying selection, and locate constrained elements covering ∼4.2{\%} of the genome. We use evolutionary signatures and comparisons with experimental data sets to suggest candidate functions for ∼60{\%} of constrained bases. These elements reveal a small number of new coding exons, candidate stop codon readthrough events and over 10,000 regions of overlapping synonymous constraint within protein-coding exons. We find 220 candidate RNA structural families, and nearly a million elements overlapping potential promoter, enhancer and insulator regions. We report specific amino acid residues that have undergone positive selection, 280,000 non-coding elements exapted from mobile elements and more than 1,000 primate- and human-accelerated elements. Overlap with disease-associated variants indicates that our findings will be relevant for studies of human biology, health and disease.},

abstract = {Tumorigenesis in humans is thought to be a multistep process where certain mutations confer a selective advantage, allowing lineages derived from the mutated cell to outcompete other cells. Although molecular cell biology has substantially advanced cancer research, our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics that govern tumorigenesis is limited. This paper analyzes the computational implications of cancer progression presented by Hanahan and Weinberg in The Hallmarks of Cancer. We model the complexities of tumor progression as a small set of underlying rules that govern the transformation of normal cells to tumor cells. The rules are implemented in a stochastic multistep model. The model predicts that (i) early-onset cancers proceed through a different sequence of mutation acquisition than late-onset cancers; (ii) tumor heterogeneity varies with acquisition of genetic instability, mutation pathway, and selective pressures during tumorigenesis; (iii) there exists an optimal initial telomere length which lowers cancer incidence and raises time of cancer onset; and (iv) the ability to initiate angiogenesis is an important stage-setting mutation, which is often exploited by other cells. The model offers insight into how the sequence of acquired mutations affects the timing and cellular makeup of the resulting tumor and how the cellular-level population dynamics drive neoplastic evolution.},

abstract = {The relative scarcity of the results reported by genetic association studies (GAS) prompted many research directions. Despite the centrality of the concept of association in GASs, refined concepts of association are missing; meanwhile, various feature subset selection methods became de facto standards for defining multivariate relevance. On the other hand, probabilistic graphical models, including Bayesian networks (BNs) are more and more popular, as they can learn nontransitive, multivariate, nonlinear relations between complex phenotypic descriptors and heterogeneous explanatory variables. To integrate the advantages of Bayesian statistics and BNs, the Bayesian network based Bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance (BN-BMLA) was proposed. This approach allows the processing of multiple target variables, while ensuring scalability and providing a multilevel view of the results of multivariate analysis. This chapter discusses the use of Bayesian BN-based analysis of relevance in exploratory data analysis, optimal decision and study design, and knowledge fusion, in the context of GASs.},

abstract = {The emergence of benchtop sequencers has made clinical genetic testing using next-generation sequencing more feasible. Ion Torrent's PGM™ is one such benchtop sequencer that shows clinical promise in detecting single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and microindel variations (indels). However, the large number of false positive indels caused by the high frequency of homopolymer sequencing errors has impeded PGM™'s usage for clinical genetic testing. An extensive analysis of PGM™ data from the sequencing reads of the well-characterized genome of the Escherichia coli DH10B strain and sequences of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from six germline samples was done. Three commonly used variant detection tools, SAMtools, Dindel, and GATK's Unified Genotyper, all had substantial false positive rates for indels. By incorporating filters on two major measures we could dramatically improve false positive rates without sacrificing sensitivity. The two measures were: B-Allele Frequency (BAF) and VARiation of the Width of gaps and inserts (VARW) per indel position. A BAF threshold applied to indels detected by UnifiedGenotyper removed {\~{}}99{\%} of the indel errors detected in both the DH10B and BRCA sequences. The optimum BAF threshold for BRCA sequences was determined by requiring 100{\%} detection sensitivity and minimum false discovery rate, using variants detected from Sanger sequencing as reference. This resulted in 15 indel errors remaining, of which 7 indel errors were removed by selecting a VARW threshold of zero. VARW specific errors increased in frequency with higher read depth in the BRCA datasets, suggesting that homopolymer-associated indel errors cannot be reduced by increasing the depth of coverage. Thus, using a VARW threshold is likely to be important in reducing indel errors from data with higher coverage. In conclusion, BAF and VARW thresholds provide simple and effective filtering criteria that can improve the specificity of indel detection in PGM™ data without compromising sensitivity.},

abstract = {Evolvability is an organism's capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation. Metazoan evolution is marked by great morphological and physiological diversification, although the core genetic, cell biological, and developmental processes are largely conserved. Metazoan diversification has entailed the evolution of various regulatory processes controlling the time, place, and conditions of use of the conserved core processes. These regulatory processes, and certain of the core processes, have special properties relevant to evolutionary change. The properties of versatile protein elements, weak linkage, compartmentation, redundancy, and exploratory behavior reduce the interdependence of components and confer robustness and flexibility on processes during embryonic development and in adult physiology. They also confer evolvability on the organism by reducing constraints on change and allowing the accumulation of nonlethal variation. Evolvability may have been generally selected in the course of selection for robust, flexible processes suitable for complex development and physiology and specifically selected in lineages undergoing repeated radiations.},

abstract = {The natural reservoir of Influenza A is waterfowl. Normally, waterfowl viruses are not adapted to infect and spread in the human population. Sometimes, through reassortment or through whole host shift events, genetic material from waterfowl viruses is introduced into the human population causing worldwide pandemics. Identifying which mutations allow viruses from avian origin to spread successfully in the human population is of great importance in predicting and controlling influenza pandemics. Here we describe a novel approach to identify such mutations. We use a sitewise non-homogeneous phylogenetic model that explicitly takes into account differences in the equilibrium frequencies of amino acids in different hosts and locations. We identify 172 amino acid sites with strong support and 518 sites with moderate support of different selection constraints in human and avian viruses. The sites that we identify provide an invaluable resource to experimental virologists studying adaptation of avian flu viruses to the human host. Identification of the sequence changes necessary for host shifts would help us predict the pandemic potential of various strains. The method is of broad applicability to investigating changes in selective constraints when the timing of the changes is known.},

abstract = {Strikingly consistent correlations between rates of coding-sequence evolution and gene expression levels are apparent across taxa, but the biological causes behind the selective pressures on coding-sequence evolution remain controversial. Here, we demonstrate conserved patterns of simple covariation between sequence evolution, codon usage, and mRNA level in E. coli, yeast, worm, fly, mouse, and human that suggest that all observed trends stem largely from a unified underlying selective pressure. In metazoans, these trends are strongest in tissues composed of neurons, whose structure and lifetime confer extreme sensitivity to protein misfolding. We propose, and demonstrate using a molecular-level evolutionary simulation, that selection against toxicity of misfolded proteins generated by ribosome errors suffices to create all of the observed covariation. The mechanistic model of molecular evolution that emerges yields testable biochemical predictions, calls into question the use of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution ratios (Ka/Ks) to detect functional selection, and suggests how mistranslation may contribute to neurodegenerative disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND A key step in cancer genome analysis is the identification of somatic mutations in the tumor. This is typically done by comparing the genome of the tumor to the reference genome sequence derived from a normal tissue taken from the same donor. However, there are a variety of common scenarios in which matched normal tissue is not available for comparison. RESULTS In this work, we describe an algorithm to distinguish somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in next-generation sequencing data from germline polymorphisms in the absence of normal samples using a machine learning approach. Our algorithm was evaluated using a family of supervised learning classifications across six different cancer types and {\~{}}1600 samples, including cell lines, fresh frozen tissues, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues; we tested our algorithm with both deep targeted and whole-exome sequencing data. Our algorithm correctly classified between 95 and 98{\%} of somatic mutations with F1-measure ranges from 75.9 to 98.6{\%} depending on the tumor type. We have released the algorithm as a software package called ISOWN (Identification of SOmatic mutations Without matching Normal tissues). CONCLUSIONS In this work, we describe the development, implementation, and validation of ISOWN, an accurate algorithm for predicting somatic mutations in cancer tissues in the absence of matching normal tissues.

It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader.},

abstract = {The identification of functionally important residues is an important challenge for understanding the molecular mechanisms of proteins. Membrane protein transporters operate two-state allosteric conformational changes using functionally important cooperative residues that mediate long-range communication from the substrate binding site to the translocation pathway. In this study, we identified functionally important cooperative residues of membrane protein transporters by integrating sequence conservation and co-evolutionary information. A newly derived evolutionary feature, the co-evolutionary coupling number, was introduced to measure the connectivity of co-evolving residue pairs and was integrated with the sequence conservation score. We tested this method on three Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporters, LacY, GlpT, and EmrD. MFS transporters are an important family of membrane protein transporters, which utilize diverse substrates, catalyze different modes of transport using unique combinations of functional residues, and have enough characterized functional residues to validate the performance of our method. We found that the conserved cores of evolutionarily coupled residues are involved in specific substrate recognition and translocation of MFS transporters. Furthermore, a subset of the residues forms an interaction network connecting functional sites in the protein structure. We also confirmed that our method is effective on other membrane protein transporters. Our results provide insight into the location of functional residues important for the molecular mechanisms of membrane protein transporters.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing studies of de novo mutations in humans have revealed surprising incongruities in our understanding of human germline mutation. In particular, the mutation rate observed in modern humans is substantially lower than that estimated from calibration against the fossil record, and the paternal age effect in mutations transmitted to offspring is much weaker than expected from our long-standing model of spermatogenesis. I consider possible explanations for these discrepancies, including evolutionary changes in life-history parameters such as generation time and the age of puberty, a possible contribution from undetected post-zygotic mutations early in embryo development, and changes in cellular mutation processes at different stages of the germline. I suggest a revised model of stem-cell state transitions during spermatogenesis, in which 'dark' gonial stem cells play a more active role than hitherto envisaged, with a long cycle time undetected in experimental observations. More generally, I argue that the mutation rate and its evolution depend intimately on the structure of the germline in humans and other primates.This article is part of the themed issue 'Dating species divergences using rocks and clocks'.},

@article{Simons2016,
abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been both great interest and confusion about whether recent demographic events—notably the Out-of-Africa-bottleneck and recent population growth—have led to differences in mutation load among human populations. The confusion can be traced to the use of different summary statistics to measure load, which lead to apparently conflicting results. We argue, however, that when statistics more directly related to load are used, the results of different studies and data sets consistently reveal little or no difference in the load of non-synonymous mutations among human populations. Theory helps to understand why no such differences are seen, as well as to predict in what settings they are to be expected. In particular, as predicted by modeling, there is evidence for changes in the load of recessive loss of function mutations in founder and inbred human populations. Also as predicted, eastern subspecies of gorilla, Neanderthals and Denisovans, who are thought to have undergone reductions in population sizes that exceed the human Out-of-Africa bottleneck in duration and severity, show evidence for increased load of non-synonymous mutations (relative to western subspecies of gorillas and modern humans, respectively). A coherent picture is thus starting to emerge about the effects of demographic history on the mutation load in populations of humans and close evolutionary relatives.},

Genomic sampling of a patient's cancer provides a molecular history, represented by a phylogenetic tree. Cohorts of patients represent a forest of related phylogenetic structures. To extract clinically relevant information, one must represent and statistically compare these collections of trees. We propose a framework based on an application of the work by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann on phylogenetic tree spaces to the case of unrooted trees of intra-individual cancer tissue samples. We observe that these tree spaces are globally nonpositively curved, allowing for statistical inference on populations of patient histories. A projective tree space is introduced, permitting visualizations of aggregate evolutionary behavior. Published data from three types of human malignancies are explored within our framework.},

abstract = {Current models of codon substitution are formulated at the levels of nucleotide substitution and do not explicitly consider the separate effects of mutation and selection. They are thus incapable of inferring whether mutation or selection is responsible for evolution at silent sites. Here we implement a few population genetics models of codon substitution that explicitly consider mutation bias and natural selection at the DNA level. Selection on codon usage is modeled by introducing codon-fitness parameters, which together with mutation-bias parameters, predict optimal codon frequencies for the gene. The selective pressure may be for translational efficiency and accuracy or for fine-tuning translational kinetics to produce correct protein folding. We apply the models to compare mitochondrial and nuclear genes from several mammalian species. Model assumptions concerning codon usage are found to affect the estimation of sequence distances (such as the synonymous rate dS, the nonsynonymous rate dN, and the rate at the 4-fold degenerate sites d4), as found in previous studies, but the new models produced very similar estimates to some old ones. We also develop a likelihood ratio test to examine the null hypothesis that codon usage is due to mutation bias alone, not influenced by natural selection. Application of the test to the mammalian data led to rejection of the null hypothesis in most genes, suggesting that natural selection may be a driving force in the evolution of synonymous codon usage in mammals. Estimates of selection coefficients nevertheless suggest that selection on codon usage is weak and most mutations are nearly neutral. The sensitivity of the analysis on the assumed mutation model is discussed.},

abstract = {The repertoire of proteins and nucleic acids in the living world is determined by evolution; their properties are determined by the laws of physics and chemistry. Explanations of these two kinds of causality - the purviews of evolutionary biology and biochemistry, respectively - are typically pursued in isolation, but many fundamental questions fall squarely at the interface of fields. Here we articulate the paradigm of evolutionary biochemistry, which aims to dissect the physical mechanisms and evolutionary processes by which biological molecules diversified and to reveal how their physical architecture facilitates and constrains their evolution. We show how an integration of evolution with biochemistry moves us towards a more complete understanding of why biological molecules have the properties that they do.},

Microarray-based comparative genome hybridization (arrayCGH) or genotyping arrays have been standard technologies to detect large regions subject to copy number changes in genomes until most recently high-resolution sequence data can be analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). During the last several years, NGS-based analysis has been widely applied to identify CNVs in both healthy and diseased individuals. Correspondingly, the strong demand for NGS-based CNV analyses has fuelled development of numerous computational methods and tools for CNV detection. In this article, we review the recent advances in computational methods pertaining to CNV detection using whole genome and whole exome sequencing data. Additionally, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses and suggest directions for future development.},

abstract = {1. Non-linear polarization currents apparently due to permanent dipoles or mobile charges in the membrane can be measured by appropriate comparison of the transient currents required to produce small and large steps of membrane potential. Integration of these transient polarization currents estimates the charge transfer associated with the movement of membrane dipoles or charges. 2. Depolarization from -100 to 0 mV requires a charge transfer of 35 nC/muF in addition to the charge transfer predicted by linear extrapolation of the charge required for a small depolarization from -100 mV. Depolarizations of varying size give a charge-voltage relation which is sigmoid saturating beyond o mV and with a midpoint at about -50 mV. The ratnged depolarization reduces or removes charge movement detected by comparing currents for small and large voltage steps from -100 mV (Charge 1). However in depolarized fibres comparison of currents from a small potential step at +40 mV and a large hyperpolarizing potential step from -20 mV reveals large movements of a second charge (Charge 2). Movement of Charge 2 is less steeply dependent on voltage than movement of Charge 2 both in magnitude and in rate. 4. In size and voltage dependence these two kinds of charge movement correspond to measured voltage dependence of capacity in normally polarized and depolarized fibres (Adrian {\&} Almers, 1976).},

abstract = {Protein interaction networks are a promising type of data for studying complex biological systems. However, despite the rich information embedded in these networks, these networks face important data quality challenges of noise and incompleteness that adversely affect the results obtained from their analysis. Here, we apply a robust measure of local network structure called common neighborhood similarity (CNS) to address these challenges. Although several CNS measures have been proposed in the literature, an understanding of their relative efficacies for the analysis of interaction networks has been lacking. We follow the framework of graph transformation to convert the given interaction network into a transformed network corresponding to a variety of CNS measures evaluated. The effectiveness of each measure is then estimated by comparing the quality of protein function predictions obtained from its corresponding transformed network with those from the original network. Using a large set of human and fly protein interactions, and a set of over 100 GO terms for both, we find that several of the transformed networks produce more accurate predictions than those obtained from the original network. In particular, the HC.cont measure and other continuous CNS measures perform well this task, especially for large networks. Further investigation reveals that the two major factors contributing to this improvement are the abilities of CNS measures to prune out noisy edges and enhance functional coherence in the transformed networks.},

abstract = {With incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), the genealogy of closely related species differs along their genomes. The amount of ILS depends on population parameters such as the ancestral effective population sizes and the recombination rate, but also on the number of generations between speciation events. We use a hidden Markov model parameterized according to coalescent theory to infer the genealogy along a four-species genome alignment of closely related species and estimate population parameters. We analyze a basic, panmictic demographic model and study its properties using an extensive set of coalescent simulations. We assess the effect of the model assumptions and demonstrate that the Markov property provides a good approximation to the ancestral recombination graph. Using a too restricted set of possible genealogies, necessary to reduce the computational load, can bias parameter estimates. We propose a simple correction for this bias and suggest directions for future extensions of the model. We show that the patterns of ILS along a sequence alignment can be recovered efficiently together with the ancestral recombination rate. Finally, we introduce an extension of the basic model that allows for mutation rate heterogeneity and reanalyze human-chimpanzee-gorilla-orangutan alignments, using the new models. We expect that this framework will prove useful for population genomics and provide exciting insights into genome evolution.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein sequences found in databanks usually do not report post translational covalent modifications such as the oxidation state of cystein (Cys) residues. Accurate prediction of whether a functionally or structurally important Cys occurs in the oxidized or thiol form would be helpful for molecular biology experiments and structure prediction. RESULTS: A new method is presented for predicting the oxidation state of Cys residues based on multiple sequence alignments and on the observation that Cys tends to occur in the same oxidation state within the same protein. The prediction of the redox state of Cys performs above 82{\%}. The oxidation state of Cys correlates with the cellular location of the given protein within the cell, but the correlation is not perfect (up to 70{\%}). We also perform a statistical analysis of the different redox states of Cys found in secondary structures and buried positions, and of the secondary structures linked by disulfide bonds. The results suggest that the natural borderline lies between the different oxidation states of Cys rather than between the half cystines and cysteins.

These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.$\backslash$nAvailability: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.$\backslash$nContact: bolstad@stat.berkeley.edu.$\backslash$nSupplementary information: Additional figures may be found at http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/{\~{}}bolstad/normalize/index.html},

Genetic and molecular definition of these three immune hallmarks of cancer offers the opportunity to learn how to deploy specific countermeasures to reverse the situation in favor of the immune system and, eventually, the patient.

abstract = {Opening of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl channels requires their phosphorylation by protein kinase A followed by exposure to ATP. We examined the interaction between nucleotides and phosphorylated CFTR channels by recording currents in intact cardiac myocytes and in excised patches. We found that, although the hydrolysis-resistant ATP analogue 5'-adenosine(beta,gamma- imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) cannot open phosphorylated CFTR channels, it can cause channels opened by ATP to remain open for many minutes. This suggests that ATP action at one site on CFTR is a prerequisite for AMP-PNP action at a second site. However, this action of AMP-PNP is restricted to highly phosphorylated CFTR channels, which, in the presence of ATP, display a relatively high open probability, but is not seen in partially phosphorylated CFTR channels, which have a low open probability in the presence of ATP. Our findings argue that incremental phosphorylation differentially regulates the interactions between nucleotides and the two nucleotide binding domains of CFTR. The nature of those interactions suggests that ATP hydrolysis at one nucleotide binding domain controls channel opening and ATP hydrolysis at the other regulates channel closing.},

Here we propose a novel gene network reconstruction algorithm, derived from classic Bayesian network methods, that utilizes naturally occurring genetic variations as a source of perturbations to elucidate the network. This algorithm incorporates relative transcript abundance and genotypic data from segregating populations by employing a generalized scoring function of maximum likelihood commonly used in Bayesian network reconstruction problems. The utility of this novel algorithm is demonstrated via application to liver gene expression data from a segregating mouse population. We demonstrate that the network derived from these data using our novel network reconstruction algorithm is able to capture causal associations between genes that result in increased predictive power, compared to more classically reconstructed networks derived from the same data.},

However, before such protein nanopores can be used to their full potential, the conformational dynamics and translocation pathway of the DNA within them must be characterized at the individual molecule level. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of single-stranded DNA movement through a model ??-hemolysin pore under an applied electric field. The simulations enable characterization of the conformations adopted by single-stranded DNA, and allow exploration of how the conformations may impact on translocation within the wild-type model pore and a number of mutants. Our results show that specific interactions between the protein nanopore and the DNA can have a significant impact on the DNA conformation often leading to localized coiling, which in turn, can alter the order in which the DNA bases exit the nanopore. Thus, our simulations show that strategies to control the conformation of DNA within a protein nanopore would be a distinct advantage for the purposes of DNA sequencing. ?? 2012 Biophysical Society.},

The mutational behaviour is deduced from multiple sequence alignments. Our findings are that there is, indeed, some valuable information available from this source and that it is sufficient to make a significant improvement in our ability to predict contacts, when compared with earlier methods that do not take into account the correlations between the mutations. This improvement is approximately twice as large as can be obtained by the more economical method of simply averaging pair preferences over the same sequence alignment. Even when using a method based on pair preferences, a further significant improvement can be made by penalizing more variable regions (on the reasonable assumption that invariant residues are relatively more likely to be in contact), though we have found no way of improving the pair preference method to the extent that it matches the method based on correlated behaviour. Our new method is thought to be the best data-based method of contact prediction developed so far, achieving, on average, an improvement over a random (i.e. information-free) prediction of a factor of five when the number of contacts predicted is chosen to match the number that actually occur.},

To this end, we developed a powerful and flexible hierarchical Bayesian model that combines information across loci to allow both global and locus-specific inferences about allele-specific expression (ASE). We applied our methodology to a large RNA-seq data set obtained in a diploid hybrid of two diverse Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, as well as to RNA-seq data from an individual human genome. Our statistical framework accurately quantifies levels of ASE with specified false-discovery rates, achieving high reproducibility between independent sequencing platforms. We pinpoint loci that show unusual and biologically interesting patterns of ASE, including allele-specific alternative splicing and transcription termination sites.

A further complication is that any given rare variant could have no effect, could increase risk, or could be protective. We propose here the C-alpha test statistic as a novel approach for testing for the presence of this mixture of effects across a set of rare variants. Unlike existing burden tests, C-alpha, by testing the variance rather than the mean, maintains consistent power when the target set contains both risk and protective variants. Through simulations and analysis of case/control data, we demonstrate good power relative to existing methods that assess the burden of rare variants in individuals.},

abstract = {Sequencing studies are increasingly being conducted to identify rare variants associated with complex traits. The limited power of classical single-marker association analysis for rare variants poses a central challenge in such studies.We propose the sequence kernel association test (SKAT), a supervised, flexible, computationally efficient regression method to test for association between genetic variants (common and rare) in a region and a continuous or dichotomous trait while easily adjusting for covariates. As a score-based variance- component test, SKAT can quickly calculate p values analytically by fitting the null model containing only the covariates, and so can easily be applied to genome-wide data. Using SKAT to analyze a genome-wide sequencing study of 1000 individuals, by segmenting the whole genome into 30 kb regions, requires only 7 hr on a laptop. Through analysis of simulated data across a wide range of practical scenarios and triglyceride data from the Dallas Heart Study, we show that SKAT can substantially outperform several alternative rare-variant association tests.We also provide analytic power and sample-size calculations to help design candidate-gene, whole-exome, and whole-genome sequence association studies. ?? 2011 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

Though hundreds of human microRNAs are known, only a few have known functions. Here, we predict human microRNA functions by using a new method that systematically assesses the statistical enrichment of several microRNA-targeting signatures in annotated gene sets such as signaling networks and protein complexes. Some of our top predictions are supported by published experiments, yet many are entirely new or provide mechanistic insights to known phenotypes. Our results indicate that coordinated microRNA targeting of closely connected genes is prevalent across pathways. We use the same method to infer which microRNAs regulate similar targets and provide the first genome-wide evidence of pervasive cotargeting, in which a handful of “hub” microRNAs are involved in a majority of cotargeting relationships. Our method and analyses pave the way to systematic discovery of microRNA functions.},

Here we describe the dynamics of fusion of the secretory granules in individual mast cells during exocytosis. The cell membrane capacitance (proportional to the cell surface area) was measured using the whole-cell patch-pipette technique, in which the intracellular space is dialysed with the solutions used to fill the patch pipette. Our results show that degranulation occurs spontaneously and reproducibly if the GTP analogue, GTP-gamma-S, and Mg-ATP are present in the pipette filling solution. Contrary to previous reports, in these conditions Ca2+ (and/or Ca2+ buffers) is not required for degranulation. Although electrogenic Ca2+ entry was not detected before or during degranulation and membrane conductance remained low, the capacitance, and by implication the area of the membrane of degranulating cells, increased sigmoidally and stepwise. We conclude that stepwise increases of capacitance are due to the fusion of individual secretory granules with the plasma membrane, and that guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins are involved in the control of this process.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene duplications have a major role in the evolution of new biological functions. Theoretical studies often assume that a duplication per se is selectively neutral and that, following a duplication, one of the gene copies is freed from purifying (stabilizing) selection, which creates the potential for evolution of a new function. RESULTS: In search of systematic evidence of accelerated evolution after duplication, we used data from 26 bacterial, six archaeal, and seven eukaryotic genomes to compare the mode and strength of selection acting on recently duplicated genes (paralogs) and on similarly diverged, unduplicated orthologous genes in different species. We find that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (Kn/Ks) in most paralogous pairs is {\textless}{\textless}1 and that paralogs typically evolve at similar rates, without significant asymmetry, indicating that both paralogs produced by a duplication are subject to purifying selection. This selection is, however, substantially weaker than the purifying selection affecting unduplicated orthologs that have diverged to the same extent as the analyzed paralogs. Most of the recently duplicated genes appear to be involved in various forms of environmental response; in particular, many of them encode membrane and secreted proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis indicate that recently duplicated paralogs evolve faster than orthologs with the same level of divergence and similar functions, but apparently do not experience a phase of neutral evolution. We hypothesize that gene duplications that persist in an evolving lineage are beneficial from the time of their origin, due primarily to a protein dosage effect in response to variable environmental conditions; duplications are likely to give rise to new functions at a later phase of their evolution once a higher level of divergence is reached.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plays a critical role in transcellular ion transport and when defective, results in the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. CFTR is novel in the ATP-binding cassette superfamily as an ion channel that is enabled by a unique unstructured regulatory domain. This R domain contains multiple protein kinase A sites, which when phosphorylated allow channel gating. Most of the sites have been indicated to stimulate channel activity, while two of them have been suggested to be inhibitory. It is unknown whether individual sites act coordinately or distinctly. To address this issue, we raised monoclonal antibodies recognizing the unphosphorylated, but not the phosphorylated states of four functionally relevant sites (700, 737, 768, and 813). This enabled simultaneous monitoring of their phosphorylation and dephosphorylation and revealed that both processes occurred rapidly at the first three sites, but more slowly at the fourth. The parallel phosphorylation rates of the stimulatory 700 and the putative inhibitory 737 and 768 sites prompted us to reexamine the role of the latter two. With serines 737 and 768 reintroduced individually into a PKA insensitive variant, in which serines at 15 sites had been replaced by alanines, a level of channel activation by PKA was restored, showing that these sites can mediate stimulation. Thus, we have provided new tools to study the CFTR regulation by phosphorylation and found that sites proposed to inhibit channel activity can also participate in stimulation.},

The mutation (R233Q) causes a twofold increase in the KD of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding to the double C2A-C2B domain of synaptotagmin. Using photolysis of caged calcium and capacitance measurements we found that secretion from mutant cells had lower secretory rates, longer secretory delays, and a higher intracellular Ca2+-threshold for secretion due to a twofold increase in the apparent KD of the Ca2+ sensor for fast exocytosis. Single amperometric fusion events were unchanged. We conclude that Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding to synaptotagmin 1 mirrors the intracellular Ca2+ dependence of exocytosis.},

abstract = {Neurotransmission relies on synaptic vesicles fusing with the membrane of nerve cells to release their neurotransmitter content into the synaptic cleft, a process requiring the assembly of several members of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) family. SNAREs represent an evolutionarily conserved protein family that mediates membrane fusion in the secretory and endocytic pathways of eukaryotic cells. On membrane contact, these proteins assemble in trans between the membranes as a bundle of four alpha-helices, with the energy released during assembly being thought to drive fusion. However, it is unclear how the energy is transferred to the membranes and whether assembly is conformationally linked to fusion. Here, we report the X-ray structure of the neuronal SNARE complex, consisting of rat syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin 2, with the carboxy-terminal linkers and transmembrane regions at 3.4 A resolution. The structure shows that assembly proceeds beyond the already known core SNARE complex, resulting in a continuous helical bundle that is further stabilized by side-chain interactions in the linker region. Our results suggest that the final phase of SNARE assembly is directly coupled to membrane merger.},

Here we used allele-sensitive single-cell RNA-seq on clonal primary mouse fibroblasts and freshly isolated human CD8(+) T cells to dissect clonal and dynamic monoallelic expression patterns. Dynamic aRME affected a considerable portion of the cells' transcriptomes, with levels dependent on the cells' transcriptional activity. Notably, clonal aRME was detected, but it was surprisingly scarce ({\textless}1{\%} of genes) and mainly affected the most weakly expressed genes. Consequently, the overwhelming majority of aRME occurs transiently within individual cells, and patterns of aRME are thus primarily scattered throughout somatic cell populations rather than, as previously hypothesized, confined to patches of clonally related cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detecting mutations in disease genes by full gene sequence analysis is common in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Sanger dideoxy terminator sequencing allows for rapid development and implementation of sequencing assays in the clinical laboratory, but it has limited throughput, and due to cost constraints, only allows analysis of one or at most a few genes in a patient. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), on the other hand, has evolved rapidly, although to date it has mainly been used for large-scale genome sequencing projects and is beginning to be used in the clinical diagnostic testing. One advantage of NGS is that many genes can be analyzed easily at the same time, allowing for mutation detection when there are many possible causative genes for a specific phenotype. In addition, regions of a gene typically not tested for mutations, like deep intronic and promoter mutations, can also be detected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we use 20 previously characterized Sanger-sequenced positive controls in disease-causing genes to demonstrate the utility of NGS in a clinical setting using standard PCR based amplification to assess the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the technology for detecting all previously characterized changes (mutations and benign SNPs). The positive controls chosen for validation range from simple substitution mutations to complex deletion and insertion mutations occurring in autosomal dominant and recessive disorders. The NGS data was 100{\%} concordant with the Sanger sequencing data identifying all 119 previously identified changes in the 20 samples.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that NGS technology is ready to be deployed in clinical laboratories. However, NGS and associated technologies are evolving, and clinical laboratories will need to invest significantly in staff and infrastructure to build the necessary foundation for success.},

The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system.

abstract = {An important element of the developing field of proteomics is to understand protein-protein interactions and other functional links amongst genes. Across-species correlation methods for detecting functional links work on the premise that functionally linked proteins will tend to show a common pattern of presence and absence across a range of genomes. We describe a maximum likelihood statistical model for predicting functional gene linkages. The method detects independent instances of the correlated gain or loss of pairs of proteins on phylogenetic trees, reducing the high rates of false positives observed in conventional across-species methods that do not explicitly incorporate a phylogeny. We show, in a dataset of 10,551 protein pairs, that the phylogenetic method improves by up to 35{\%} on across-species analyses at identifying known functionally linked proteins. The method shows that protein pairs with at least two to three correlated events of gain or loss are almost certainly functionally linked. Contingent evolution, in which one gene's presence or absence depends upon the presence of another, can also be detected phylogenetically, and may identify genes whose functional significance depends upon its interaction with other genes. Incorporating phylogenetic information improves the prediction of functional linkages. The improvement derives from having a lower rate of false positives and from detecting trends that across-species analyses miss. Phylogenetic methods can easily be incorporated into the screening of large-scale bioinformatics datasets to identify sets of protein links and to characterise gene networks.},

Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data.

The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package--PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)--that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

abstract = {Selection of significant genes via expression patterns is an important problem in microarray experiments. Owing to small sample size and the large number of variables (genes), the selection process can be unstable. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model for gene (variable) selection. We employ latent variables to specialize the model to a regression setting and uses a Bayesian mixture prior to perform the variable selection. We control the size of the model by assigning a prior distribution over the dimension (number of significant genes) of the model. The posterior distributions of the parameters are not in explicit form and we need to use a combination of truncated sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based computation techniques to simulate the parameters from the posteriors. The Bayesian model is flexible enough to identify significant genes as well as to perform future predictions. The method is applied to cancer classification via cDNA microarrays where the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with a hereditary disposition to breast cancer, and the method is used to identify a set of significant genes. The method is also applied successfully to the leukemia data. Supplementary information: http://stat.tamu.edu/people/faculty/bmallick.html Contact: bmallick@stat.tanu.edu},

abstract = {We further develop the Bayesian framework for analyzing aligned nucleotide sequence data to reconstruct phylog- enies, assess uncertainty in the reconstructions, and perform other statistical inferences. We employ a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler to sample trees and model parameter values from their joint posterior distribution. All statistical inferences are naturally based on this sample. The sample provides a most-probable tree with posterior probabilities for each clade, information that is qualitatively similar to that for the maximum-likelihood tree with bootstrap proportions and permits further inferences on tree topology, branch lengths, and model parameter values. On mod- erately large trees, the computational advantage of our method over bootstrapping a maximum-likelihood analysis can be considerable. In an example with 31 taxa, the time expended by our software is orders of magnitude less than that a widely used phylogeny package for bootstrapping maximum likelihood estimation would require to achieve comparable statistical accuracy. While there has been substantial debate over the proper interpretation of bootstrap proportions, Bayesian posterior probabilities clearly and directly quantify uncertainty in questions of biological interest, at least from a Bayesian perspective. Because our tree proposal algorithms are independent of the choice of likelihood function, they could also be used in conjunction with likelihood models more complex than those we have currently implemented.},

abstract = {Little is known about the extent to which individual microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate common processes of tumor biology across diverse cancer types. Using molecular profiles of {\textgreater}3,000 tumors from 11 human cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we systematically analyzed expression of miRNAs and mRNAs across cancer types to infer recurrent cancer-associated miRNA-target relationships. As we expected, the inferred relationships were consistent with sequence-based predictions and published data from miRNA perturbation experiments. Notably, miRNAs with recurrent target relationships were frequently regulated by genetic and epigenetic alterations across the studied cancer types. We also identify new examples of miRNAs that coordinately regulate cancer pathways, including the miR-29 family, which recurrently regulates active DNA demethylation pathway members TET1 and TDG. The online resource http://cancerminer.org allows exploration and prioritization of miRNA-target interactions that potentially regulate tumorigenesis.},

We used a genome-wide approach to uncover sex-specific parent-of-origin allelic effects in the adult mouse brain. Our study identified preferential selection of the maternally inherited X chromosome in glutamatergic neurons of the female cortex. Moreover, analysis of the cortex and hypothalamus identified 347 autosomal genes with sex-specific imprinting features. In the hypothalamus, sex-specific imprinted genes were mostly found in females, which suggests parental influence over the hypothalamic function of daughters. We show that interleukin-18, a gene linked to diseases with sex-specific prevalence, is subject to complex, regional, and sex-specific parental effects in the brain. Parent-of-origin effects thus provide new avenues for investigation of sexual dimorphism in brain function and disease.},

abstract = {The ATP-binding cassette is the most abundant family of transporters including many medically relevant members and gathers both importers and exporters involved in the transport of a wide variety of substrates. Although three high resolution three-dimensional structures have been obtained for a prototypic exporter, MsbA, two have been subjected to much criticism. Here, conformational changes of BmrA, a multidrug bacterial transporter structurally related to MsbA, have been studied. A three-dimensional model of BmrA, based on the "open" conformation of Escherichia coli MsbA, was probed by simultaneously introducing two cysteine residues, one in the first intracellular loop of the transmembrane domain and the other in the Q-loop of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Intramolecular disulfide bonds could be created in the absence of any effectors, which prevented both drug transport and ATPase activity. Interestingly, addition of ATP/Mg plus vanadate strongly prevented this bond formation in a cysteine double mutant, whereas ATP/Mg alone was sufficient when the ATPase-inactive E504Q mutation was also introduced, in agreement with additional BmrA models where the ATP-binding sites are positioned at the NBD/NBD interface. Furthermore, cross-linking between the two cysteine residues could still be achieved in the presence of ATP/Mg plus vanadate when homobifunctional cross-linkers separated by more than 13 Angstrom were added. Altogether, these results give support to the existence, in the resting state, of a monomeric conformation of BmrA similar to that found within the open MsbA dimer and show that a large motion is required between intracellular loop 1 and the nucleotide-binding domain for the proper functioning of a multidrug ATP-binding cassette transporter.},

abstract = {The two universally required components of the intracellular membrane fusion machinery, SNARE and SM (Sec1/Munc18-like) proteins, play complementary roles in fusion. Vesicular and target membrane-localized SNARE proteins zipper up into an alpha-helical bundle that pulls the two membranes tightly together to exert the force required for fusion. SM proteins, shaped like clasps, bind to trans-SNARE complexes to direct their fusogenic action. Individual fusion reactions are executed by distinct combinations of SNARE and SM proteins to ensure specificity, and are controlled by regulators that embed the SM-SNARE fusion machinery into a physiological context. This regulation is spectacularly apparent in the exquisite speed and precision of synaptic exocytosis, where synaptotagmin (the calcium-ion sensor for fusion) cooperates with complexin (the clamp activator) to control the precisely timed release of neurotransmitters that initiates synaptic transmission and underlies brain function.},

abstract = {Advances in sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), represent an opportunity to perform genetic testing in a clinical scenario. In this study, we developed and tested a method for the detection of mutations in the large BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes, using long-range PCR (LR-PCR) and NGS, in samples from individuals with a personal and/or family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Eleven LR-PCR fragments, between 3000 and 15,300 bp, containing all coding exons and flanking splice junctions of BRCA1 and BRCA2, were obtained from DNA samples of five individuals carrying mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2. Libraries for NGS were prepared using an enzymatic (Nextera technology) method. We analyzed five individual samples in parallel by NGS and obtained complete coverage of all LR-PCR fragments, with an average coding sequence depth for each nucleotide of {\textgreater}30 reads, running from ×7 (in exon 22 of BRCA1) to {\textgreater}×150. We detected and confirmed 100{\%} of the mutations that predispose to the risk of cancer, together with other genomic variations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Our approach demonstrates that genomic LR-PCR, together with NGS, using the GS Junior 454 System platform, is an effective method for patient sample analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. In addition, this method could be performed in regular molecular genetics laboratories. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.},

RESULTS: We give an algorithm that guarantees finding the global maximum. The efficient search method makes our method applicable to datasets with large number sequences.

We characterized DNAm in prefrontal cortex from 335 non-psychiatric controls across the lifespan and 191 patients with schizophrenia and identified widespread changes in the transition from prenatal to postnatal life. These DNAm changes manifest in the transcriptome, correlate strongly with a shifting cellular landscape and overlap regions of genetic risk for schizophrenia. A quarter of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS)-suggestive loci (4,208 of 15,930, P {\textless} 10(-100)) manifest as significant methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), including 59.6{\%} of GWAS-positive schizophrenia loci. We identified 2,104 CpGs that differ between schizophrenia patients and controls that were enriched for genes related to development and neurodifferentiation. The schizophrenia-associated CpGs strongly correlate with changes related to the prenatal-postnatal transition and show slight enrichment for GWAS risk loci while not corresponding to CpGs differentiating adolescence from later adult life. These data implicate an epigenetic component to the developmental origins of this disorder.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression variation can often be linked to certain chromosomal regions and are tightly associated with phenotypic variation such as disease conditions. Inferring the causal genes for the expression variation is of great importance but rather challenging as the linked region generally contains multiple genes. Even when a single candidate gene is proposed, the underlying biological mechanism by which the regulation is enforced remains unknown. Novel approaches are needed to both infer the causal genes and generate hypothesis on the underlying regulatory mechanisms. RESULTS: We propose a new approach which aims at achieving the above objectives by integrating genotype information, gene expression, protein-protein interaction, protein phosphorylation, and transcription factor (TF)-DNA binding information. A network based stochastic algorithm is designed to infer the causal genes and identify the underlying regulatory pathways. We first quantitatively verified our method by a test using data generated by yeast knock-out experiments. Over 40{\%} of inferred causal genes are correct, which is significantly better than 10{\%} by random guess. We then applied our method to a recent genome-wide expression variation study in yeast. We show that our method can correctly identify the causal genes and effectively output experimentally verified pathways. New potential gene regulatory pathways are generated and presented as a global network. AVAILABILITY: Source code is available upon request.},

abstract = {Semliki Forest virus (SFV) vectors can be produced faster, and have a wider host range, than baculovirus vectors. However, the original SFV system requires in vitro manipulation of RNA. We have generated a system that is wholly DNA-based. Both the replicon vector, encoding SFV polymerase and the protein of interest, and the helper vector, encoding viral structural proteins, were modified so that expression was RNA polymerase II-dependent. Transfection of the modified replicon plasmid alone generated 20-30-fold more protein than obtained from a simple expression vector. Expression required the SFV replicase, which amplifies replicon RNA. The SFV-based vector generated 10-20-fold more protein than a plasmid based on Sindbis virus. Cotransfection of SFV replicon and helper vectors generated viral titers of around 10(6) infectious particles/ml. A single electroporation, plated on one 10-cm plate, generated enough virus (10(7) particles) to produce {\textgreater}500 microg of protein. Wild type, replication proficient virus was not detected in three tests utilizing almost 10(8) viral particles, a distinct advantage over a DNA Sindbis-based system in which over half the virus particles generated are fully infectious. The new SFV vectors significantly enhance the utility of this expression system.},

abstract = {Estimation of evolutionary distances from coding sequences must take into account protein-level selection to avoid relative underestimation of longer evolutionary distances. Current modeling of selection via site-to-site rate heterogeneity generally neglects another aspect of selection, namely position-specific amino acid frequencies. These frequencies determine the maximum dissimilarity expected for highly diverged but functionally and structurally conserved sequences, and hence are crucial for estimating long distances. We introduce a codon-level model of coding sequence evolution in which position-specific amino acid frequencies are free parameters. In our implementation, these are estimated from an alignment using methods described previously. We use simulations to demonstrate the importance and feasibility of modeling such behavior; our model produces linear distance estimates over a wide range of distances, while several alternative models underestimate long distances relative to short distances. Site-to-site differences in rates, as well as synonymous/nonsynonymous and first/second/third-codon-position differences, arise as a natural consequence of the site-to-site differences in amino acid frequencies.},

abstract = {This book covers the statistical models and methods that are used to understand human genetics, following the historical and recent developments of human genetics. Starting with Mendel{\{}u2019{\}}s first experiments to genome-wide association studies, the book describes how genetic information can be incorporated into statistical models to discover disease genes. All commonly used approaches in statistical genetics (e.g. aggregation analysis, segregation, linkage analysis, etc), are used, but the focus of the book is modern approaches to association analysis. Numerous examples illustrate key points throughout the text, both of Mendelian and complex genetic disorders. The intended audience is statisticians, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and quantitatively- oriented geneticists and health scientists wanting to learn about statistical methods for genetic analysis, whether to better analyze genetic data, or to pursue research in methodology. A background in intermediate level statistical methods is required. The authors include few mathematical derivations, and the exercises provide problems for students with a broad range of skill levels. No background in genetics is assumed. Dr. Laird is a Professor of Biostatistics in the Biostatistics Department at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Laird has contributed to methodology in many different fields, including missing data, EM-algorithm, meta-analysis, statistical genetics, and has coauthored a book with Garrett Fitzmaurice and James Ware on Applied Longitudinal Analysis. She is the recipient of many awards and prizes, including Fellow of the American Statistical Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Florence Nightingale Award, and the Janet Norwood Award. Dr. Lange is an Associate Professor in the Biostatistics Department at the Harvard School of Public Health.

abstract = {While investigating microRNA targets, we have found that human genes divide into two roughly equal populations, based on the fraction of A plus T bases in their 3' UTRs. Using the Gene Ontology database, we find significant functional differences between the two gene populations, with AT-rich genes implicated in transcription and translation processes, and GC-rich genes implicated in signal transduction and posttranslational protein modification. Better understanding of the background distribution of nucleotides in 3' UTRs may allow improved prediction of microRNA-targeted genes in humans. We predict at least 1,200 KnownGene transcripts to be regulated by microRNAs. The large majority of these microRNA targets are in the AT-rich 3' UTR population. However, notwithstanding this preference for AT-rich targets, microRNA targets are found preferentially to be regulatory genes themselves, including both transcription factors and posttranslational modifiers. These results suggest that some processes involving mRNA, of which microRNA regulation may be just one, require AT-richness of 3' UTRs for functionality. A relationship, not simply one-to-one, between these 3' UTR populations and large-scale genomic isochores is described.},

To investigate the extent of the topological control of the folding process, we studied the folding of simplified models of five small globular proteins constructed using a Go-like potential to retain the information about the native structures but drastically reduce the energetic frustration and energetic heterogeneity among residue-residue native interactions. By comparing the structure of the transition state ensemble (experimentally determined by Phi-values) and of the intermediates with those obtained using our models, we show that these energetically unfrustrated models can reproduce the global experimentally known features of the transition state ensembles and "en-route" intermediates, at least for the analyzed proteins. This result clearly indicates that, as long as the protein sequence is sufficiently minimally frustrated, topology plays a central role in determining the folding mechanism.},

(i) Homo logous regions are rapidly identified by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), in which an amino acid sequence is converted to a sequence composed of volume and polarity values of each amino acid residue. (ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing CPU time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method (FFT-NS-2) and the iterative refinement method (FFT-NS-i), are implemented in MAFFT. The performances of FFT-NS-2 and FFT-NS-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the CPU time of FFT-NS-2 is drastically reduced as compared with CLUSTALW with comparable accuracy. FFT-NS-i is over 100 times faster than T-COFFEE, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

In particular, graphical "conditional independence" models have emerged as a useful class of models. Applications of such models to probabilistic expert systems, image analysis, and pedigree analysis have motivated much of this work, and several expository texts are now available. Rather less well known is the development of a Bayesian framework for such models. Expert system applications have motivated this work, where the promise of a model that can update itself as data become available, has generated intense interest from the artificial intelligence community. However, the application to a broader range of data problems has been largely overlooked. The purpose of this article is to show how Bayesian graphical models unify and simplify many standard discrete data problems such as Bayesian log linear modeling with either complete or incomplete data, closed population estimation, and double sampling. Since conventional model selection fails in these applications, we construct posterior distributions for quantities of interest by averaging across models. Specifically we introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo model composition, a Monte Carlo method for Bayesian model averaging.},

abstract = {Motivation: The rapid development of genotyping technology and extensive cataloguing of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the human genome have made genetic association studies the mainstream for gene mapping of complex human diseases. For many diseases, the most practical approach is the population-based design with unrelated individuals. Although having the advantages of easier sample collection and greater power than family-based designs, unrecognized population stratification in the study samples can lead to both false-positive and false-negative findings and might obscure the true association signals if not appropriately corrected. Methods: We report PHYLOSTRAT, a new method that corrects for population stratification by combining phylogeny constructed from SNP genotypes and principal coordinates from multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) analysis. This hybrid approach efficiently captures both discrete and admixed population structures. Results: By extensive simulations, the analysis of a synthetic genome-wide association dataset created using data from the Human Genome Diversity Project, and the analysis of a lactase-height dataset, we show that our method can correct for population stratification more efficiently than several existing population stratification correction methods, including EIGENSTRAT, a hybrid approach based on MDS and clustering, and STRATSCORE , in terms of requiring fewer random SNPs for inference of population structure. By combining the flexibility and hierarchical nature of phylogenetic trees with the advantage of representing admixture using MDS, our hybrid approach can capture the complex population structures in human populations effectively.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of protein design is to predict amino-acid sequences compatible with a given target structure. Traditionally envisioned as a purely thermodynamic question, this problem can also be understood in a wider context, where additional constraints are captured by learning the sequence patterns displayed by natural proteins of known conformation. In this latter perspective, however, we still need a theoretical formalization of the question, leading to general and efficient learning methods, and allowing for the selection of fast and accurate objective functions quantifying sequence/structure compatibility.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose a formulation of the protein design problem in terms of model-based statistical inference. Our framework uses the maximum likelihood principle to optimize the unknown parameters of a statistical potential, which we call an inverse potential to contrast with classical potentials used for structure prediction. We propose an implementation based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, in which the likelihood is maximized by gradient descent and is numerically estimated by thermodynamic integration. The fit of the models is evaluated by cross-validation. We apply this to a simple pairwise contact potential, supplemented with a solvent-accessibility term, and show that the resulting models have a better predictive power than currently available pairwise potentials. Furthermore, the model comparison method presented here allows one to measure the relative contribution of each component of the potential, and to choose the optimal number of accessibility classes, which turns out to be much higher than classically considered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Altogether, this reformulation makes it possible to test a wide diversity of models, using different forms of potentials, or accounting for other factors than just the constraint of thermodynamic stability. Ultimately, such model-based statistical analyses may help to understand the forces shaping protein sequences, and driving their evolution.},

Much information about protein flexibility has come from x-ray crystallography, in the form of atomic mean-square displacements (AMSDs) or B factors. Profiles showing the AMSD variation along the polypeptide chain are usually interpreted in dynamical terms but are ultimately governed by the local features of a highly complex energy landscape. Here, we bypass this complexity by showing that the AMSD profile is essentially determined by spatial variations in local packing density. On the basis of elementary statistical mechanics and generic features of atomic distributions in proteins, we predict a direct inverse proportionality between the AMSD and the contact density, i.e., the number of noncovalent neighbor atoms within a local region of approximately 1.5 nm(3) volume. Testing this local density model against a set of high-quality crystal structures of 38 nonhomologous proteins, we find that it accurately and consistently reproduces the prominent peaks in the AMSD profile and even captures minor features, such as the periodic AMSD variation within alpha helices. The predicted rigidifying effect of crystal contacts also agrees with experimental data. With regard to accuracy and computational efficiency, the model is clearly superior to its predecessors. The quantitative link between flexibility and packing density found here implies that AMSDs provide little independent information beyond that contained in the mean atomic coordinates.},

abstract = {Somatic mosaicism refers to the existence of somatic mutations in a fraction of somatic cells in a single biological sample. Its importance has mainly been discussed in theory although experimental work has started to emerge linking somatic mosaicism to disease diagnosis. Through novel statistical modeling of paired-end DNA-sequencing data using blood-derived DNA from healthy donors as well as DNA from tumor samples, we present an ultra-fast computational pipeline, LocHap that searches for multiple single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that are scaffolded by the same reads. We refer to scaffolded SNVs as local haplotypes (LH). When an LH exhibits more than two genotypes, we call it a local haplotype variant (LHV). The presence of LHVs is considered evidence of somatic mosaicism because a genetically homogeneous cell population will not harbor LHVs. Applying LocHap to whole-genome and whole-exome sequence data in DNA from normal blood and tumor samples, we find wide-spread LHVs across the genome. Importantly, we find more LHVs in tumor samples than in normal samples, and more in older adults than in younger ones. We confirm the existence of LHVs and somatic mosaicism by validation studies in normal blood samples. LocHap is publicly available at http://www.compgenome.org/lochap.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting protein residue-residue contacts is an important 2D prediction task. It is useful for ab initio structure prediction and understanding protein folding. In spite of steady progress over the past decade, contact prediction remains still largely unsolved. RESULTS: Here we develop a new contact map predictor (SVMcon) that uses support vector machines to predict medium- and long-range contacts. SVMcon integrates profiles, secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, contact potentials, and other useful features. On the same test data set, SVMcon's accuracy is 4{\%} higher than the latest version of the CMAPpro contact map predictor. SVMcon recently participated in the seventh edition of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP7) experiment and was evaluated along with seven other contact map predictors. SVMcon was ranked as one of the top predictors, yielding the second best coverage and accuracy for contacts with sequence separation {\textgreater} or = 12 on 13 de novo domains. CONCLUSION: We describe SVMcon, a new contact map predictor that uses SVMs and a large set of informative features. SVMcon yields good performance on medium- to long-range contact predictions and can be modularly incorporated into a structure prediction pipeline.},

Using a genome-wide approach, we assessed allele-specific transcription of about 4000 human genes in clonal cell lines and found that more than 300 were subject to random monoallelic expression. For a majority of monoallelic genes, we also observed some clonal lines displaying biallelic expression. Clonal cell lines reflect an independent choice to express the maternal, the paternal, or both alleles for each of these genes. This can lead to differences in expressed protein sequence and to differences in levels of gene expression. Unexpectedly widespread monoallelic expression suggests a mechanism that generates diversity in individual cells and their clonal descendants.},

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled a comprehensive dissection of the cancer genome clarifying a large number of somatic mutations in a wide variety of cancer types. A number of methods have been proposed for mutation calling based on a large amount of sequencing data, which is accomplished in most cases by statistically evaluating the difference in the observed allele frequencies of possible single nucleotide variants between tumours and paired normal samples. However, an accurate detection of mutations remains a challenge under low sequencing depths or tumour contents. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method, Empirical Bayesian mutation Calling (https://github.com/friend1ws/EBCall), for detecting somatic mutations. Unlike previous methods, the proposed method discriminates somatic mutations from sequencing errors based on an empirical Bayesian framework, where the model parameters are estimated using sequencing data from multiple non-paired normal samples. Using 13 whole-exome sequencing data with 87.5-206.3 mean sequencing depths, we demonstrate that our method not only outperforms several existing methods in the calling of mutations with moderate allele frequencies but also enables accurate calling of mutations with low allele frequencies (≤ 10{\%}) harboured within a minor tumour subpopulation, thus allowing for the deciphering of fine substructures within a tumour specimen.},

We review progress toward creating this new species of machine, machina economicus, and discuss some challenges in designing AIs that can reason effectively in economic contexts. Supposing that AI succeeds in this quest, or at least comes close enough that it is useful to think about AIs in rationalistic terms, we ask how to design the rules of interaction in multi-agent systems that come to represent an economy of AIs. Theories of normative design from economics may prove more relevant for artificial agents than human agents, with AIs that better respect idealized assumptions of rationality than people, interacting through novel rules and incentive systems quite distinct from those tailored for people.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The ability of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protease to develop mutations that confer multi-drug resistance (MDR) has been a major obstacle in designing rational therapies against HIV. Resistance is usually imparted by a cooperative mechanism that can be elucidated by a covariance analysis of sequence data. Identification of such correlated substitutions of amino acids may be obscured by evolutionary noise. RESULTS: HIV-1 protease sequences from patients subjected to different specific treatments (set 1), and from untreated patients (set 2) were subjected to sequence covariance analysis by evaluating the mutual information (MI) between all residue pairs. Spectral clustering of the resulting covariance matrices disclosed two distinctive clusters of correlated residues: the first, observed in set 1 but absent in set 2, contained residues involved in MDR acquisition; and the second, included those residues differentiated in the various HIV-1 protease subtypes, shortly referred to as the phylogenetic cluster. The MDR cluster occupies sites close to the central symmetry axis of the enzyme, which overlap with the global hinge region identified from coarse-grained normal-mode analysis of the enzyme structure. The phylogenetic cluster, on the other hand, occupies solvent-exposed and highly mobile regions. This study demonstrates (i) the possibility of distinguishing between the correlated substitutions resulting from neutral mutations and those induced by MDR upon appropriate clustering analysis of sequence covariance data and (ii) a connection between global dynamics and functional substitution of amino acids.},

abstract = {TRPM2 is a tetrameric Ca(2+)-permeable channel involved in immunocyte respiratory burst and in postischaemic neuronal death. In whole cells, TRPM2 activity requires intracellular ADP ribose (ADPR) and intra- or extracellular Ca(2+), but the mechanism and the binding sites for Ca(2+) activation remain unknown. Here we study TRPM2 gating in inside-out patches while directly controlling intracellular ligand concentrations. Concentration jump experiments at various voltages and Ca(2+) dependence of steady-state single-channel gating kinetics provide unprecedented insight into the molecular mechanism of Ca(2+) activation. In patches excised from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human TRPM2, coapplication of intracellular ADPR and Ca(2+) activated approximately 50-pS nonselective cation channels; K(1/2) for ADPR was approximately 1 microM at saturating Ca(2+). Intracellular Ca(2+) dependence of TRPM2 steady-state opening and closing rates (at saturating [ADPR] and low extracellular Ca(2+)) reveals that Ca(2+) activation is a consequence of tighter binding of Ca(2+) in the open rather than in the closed channel conformation. Four Ca(2+) ions activate TRPM2 with a Monod-Wymann-Changeux mechanism: each binding event increases the open-closed equilibrium constant approximately 33-fold, producing altogether 10(6)-fold activation. Experiments in the presence of 1 mM of free Ca(2+) on the extracellular side clearly show that closed channels do not sense extracellular Ca(2+), but once channels have opened Ca(2+) entering passively through the pore slows channel closure by keeping the "activating sites" saturated, despite rapid continuous Ca(2+)-free wash of the intracellular channel surface. This effect of extracellular Ca(2+) on gating is gradually lost at progressively depolarized membrane potentials, where the driving force for Ca(2+) influx is diminished. Thus, the activating sites lie intracellularly from the gate, but in a shielded crevice near the pore entrance. Our results suggest that in intact cells that contain micromolar ADPR a single brief puff of Ca(2+) likely triggers prolonged, self-sustained TRPM2 activity.},

abstract = {While the energy landscape theory of protein folding is now a widely accepted view for understanding how relatively weak molecular interactions lead to rapid and cooperative protein folding, such a framework must be extended to describe the large-scale functional motions observed in molecular machines. In this review, we discuss (1) the development of the energy landscape theory of biomolecular folding, (2) recent advances toward establishing a consistent understanding of folding and function and (3) emerging themes in the functional motions of enzymes, biomolecular motors and other biomolecular machines. Recent theoretical, computational and experimental lines of investigation have provided a very dynamic picture of biomolecular motion. In contrast to earlier ideas, where molecular machines were thought to function similarly to macroscopic machines, with rigid components that move along a few degrees of freedom in a deterministic fashion, biomolecular complexes are only marginally stable. Since the stabilizing contribution of each atomic interaction is on the order of the thermal fluctuations in solution, the rigid body description of molecular function must be revisited. An emerging theme is that functional motions encompass order-disorder transitions and structural flexibility provides significant contributions to the free energy. In this review, we describe the biological importance of order-disorder transitions and discuss the statistical-mechanical foundation of theoretical approaches that can characterize such transitions.},

abstract = {In clinical exome and genome sequencing, there is a potential for the recognition and reporting of incidental or secondary findings unrelated to the indication for ordering the sequencing but of medical value for patient care. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recently published a policy statement on clinical sequencing that emphasized the importance of alerting the patient to the possibility of such results in pretest patient discussions, clinical testing, and reporting of results. The ACMG appointed a Working Group on Incidental Findings in Clinical Exome and Genome Sequencing to make recommendations about responsible management of incidental findings when patients undergo exome or genome sequencing. This Working Group conducted a year-long consensus process, including an open forum at the 2012 Annual Meeting and review by outside experts, and produced recommendations that have been approved by the ACMG Board. Specific and detailed recommendations, and the background and rationale for these recommendations, are described herein. The ACMG recommends that laboratories performing clinical sequencing seek and report mutations of the specified classes or types in the genes listed here. This evaluation and reporting should be performed for all clinical germline (constitutional) exome and genome sequencing, including the “normal” of tumor-normal subtractive analyses in all subjects, irrespective of age but excluding fetal samples. We recognize that there are insufficient data on penetrance and clinical utility to fully support these recommendations, and we encourage the creation of an ongoing process for updating these recommendations at least annually as further data are collected.$\backslash$nGenet Med 2013:15(7):565–574},

H2DTG stops the Na/K pump without directly affecting other current pathways: (a) it causes no delta I when the pump lacks Na, K, Mg, or ATP, and (b) ouabain causes no delta I or delta phi Na in the presence of saturating H2DTG. External K (Ko) activates Na efflux with Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km = 0.45 +/- 0.06 mM [SEM]) in Na-free seawater (SW), but with sigmoid kinetics in approximately 400 mM Na SW (Hill coefficient = 1.53 +/- 0.08, K1/2 = 3.92 +/- 0.29 mM). H2DTG inhibits less strongly (Ki = 6.1 +/- 0.3 microM) in 1 or 10 mM K Na-free SW than in 10 mM K, 390 mM Na SW (1.8 +/- 0.2 microM). Dialysis with 5 mM each ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, and phosphoarginine reduced Na/Na exchange to at most 2{\%} of the H2DTG-sensitive Na efflux. H2DTG sensitive but nonpump current caused by periaxonal K accumulation upon stopping the pump, was minimized by the K channel blockers 3,4-diaminopyridine (1 mM), tetraethylammonium (approximately 200 mM), and phenylpropyltriethylammonium (20-25 mM) whose adequacy was tested by varying [K]o (0-10 mM) with H2DTG present. Two ancillary clamp circuits suppressed stray current from the axon ends. Current and flux measured from the center pool derive from the same membrane area since, over the voltage range -60 to +20 mV, tetrodotoxin-sensitive current and Na efflux into Na-free SW, under K-free conditions, were equal. The stoichiometry and voltage dependence of pump Na/K exchange were examined at near-saturating [ATP], [K]o and [Na]i in both Na-free and 390 mM Na SW. The H2DTG-sensitive F delta phi Na/delta I ratio (F is Faraday's constant) of paired measurements corrected for membrane area match, was 2.86 +/- 0.09 (n = 8) at 0 mV and 3.05 +/- 0.13 (n = 6) at -60 to -90 mV in Na-free SW, and 2.72 +/- 0.09 (n = 7) at 0 mV and 2.91 +/- 0.21 (n = 4) at -60 mV in 390 mM Na SW. Its overall mean value was 2.87 +/- 0.07 (n = 25), which was not significantly different from the 3.0 expected of a 3 Na/2 K pump.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Trellis display is a framework for the visualization of data. Its most prominent aspect is an overall visual design, reminiscent of a garden trelliswork, in which panels are laid out into rows, columns, and pages. On each panel of the trellis, a subset of the data is graphed by a display method such as a scatterplot, curve plot, boxplot, 3-D wireframe, normal quantile plot, or dot plot. Each panel shows the relationship of certain variables conditional on the values of other variables. A number of display methods employed in the visual design of Trellis display enable it to succeed in uncovering the structure of data even when the structure is quite complicated. For example, Trellis display provides a powerful mechanism for understanding interactions in studies of how a response depends on explanatory variables. Three examples demonstrate this; in each case, we make important discoveries not appreciated in the original analyses. Several control methods are also essential to Trellis display. A control method is a technique for specifying information so that a display can be drawn. The control methods of Trellis display form a basic conceptual framework that can be used in designing software. We have demonstrated the viability of the control methods by implementing them in the S/S-PLUS system for graphics and data analysis, but they can be implemented in any software system with a basic capability for drawing graphs.},

Using tissue from three distinct regions of the adult brain (prefrontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum), we found that most fetal brain mQTLs were developmentally stable, although a subset was characterized by fetal-specific effects. Fetal brain mQTLs were enriched amongst risk loci identified in a recent large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia, a severe psychiatric disorder with a hypothesized neurodevelopmental component. Finally, we found that mQTLs can be used to refine GWAS loci through the identification of discrete sites of variable fetal brain methylation associated with schizophrenia risk variants.},

abstract = {A method has been developed to detect pairs of positions with correlated mutations in protein multiple sequence alignments. The method is based on reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree for a set of sequences and statistical analysis of the distribution of mutations in the branches of the tree. The database of homology-derived protein structures (HSSP) is used as the source of multiple sequence alignments for proteins of known three-dimensional structure. We analyse pairs of positions with correlated mutations in 67 protein families and show quantitatively that the presence of such positions is a typical feature of protein families. A significant but weak tendency is observed for correlated residue pairs to be close in the three-dimensional structure. With further improvements, methods of this type may be useful for the prediction of residue--residue contacts and subsequent prediction of protein structure using distance geometry algorithms. In conclusion, we suggest a new experimental approach to protein structure determination in which selection of functional mutants after random mutagenesis and analysis of correlated mutations provide sufficient proximity constraints for calculation of the protein fold.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators that bind to their target mRNAs through base complementarity. Predicting miRNA targets is a challenging task and various studies showed that existing algorithms suffer from high number of false predictions and low to moderate overlap in their predictions. Until recently, very few algorithms considered the dynamic nature of the interactions, including the effect of less specific interactions, the miRNA expression level, and the effect of combinatorial miRNA binding. Addressing these issues can result in a more accurate miRNA:mRNA modeling with many applications, including efficient miRNA-related SNP evaluation. We present a novel thermodynamic model based on the Fermi-Dirac equation that incorporates miRNA expression in the prediction of target occupancy and we show that it improves the performance of two popular single miRNA target finders. Modeling combinatorial miRNA targeting is a natural extension of this model. Two other algorithms show improved prediction efficiency when combinatorial binding models were considered. ComiR (Combinatorial miRNA targeting), a novel algorithm we developed, incorporates the improved predictions of the four target finders into a single probabilistic score using ensemble learning. Combining target scores of multiple miRNAs using ComiR improves predictions over the na{\"{i}}ve method for target combination. ComiR scoring scheme can be used for identification of SNPs affecting miRNA binding. As proof of principle, ComiR identified rs17737058 as disruptive to the miR-488-5p:NCOA1 interaction, which we confirmed in vitro. We also found rs17737058 to be significantly associated with decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in two independent cohorts indicating that the miR-488-5p/NCOA1 regulatory axis is likely critical in maintaining BMD in women. With increasing availability of comprehensive high-throughput datasets from patients ComiR is expected to become an essential tool for miRNA-related studies.},

abstract = {The V3 loop of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope protein is a highly variable region that is both functionally and immunologically important. Using available amino acid sequences from the V3 region, we have used an information theoretic quantity called mutual information, a measure of covariation, to quantify dependence between mutations in the loop. Certain pairs of sites, including non-contiguous sites along the sequence, do not have independent mutations but display considerable, statistically significant, covarying mutations as measured by mutual information. For the pairs of sites with the highest mutual information, specific amino acids were identified that were highly predictive of amino acids in the linked site. The observed interdependence between variable sites may have implications for structural or functional relationships; separate experimental evidence indicates functional linkage between some of the pairs of sites with high mutual information. Further specific mutational studies of the V3 loop's role in determining viral phenotype are suggested by our analyses. Also, the implications of our results may be important to consider for V3 peptide vaccine design. The methods used here are generally applicable to the study of variable proteins.},

This includes not only proteins' native structures, but also all their respective functional states, including functionally important intermediates. Here, we reveal a signature of functionally important states in several protein families, using direct coupling analysis, which detects residue pair coevolution of protein sequence composition. This signature is exploited in a protein structure-based model to uncover conformational diversity, including hidden functional configurations. We uncovered, with high resolution (mean {\~{}}1.9 {\AA} rmsd for nonapo structures), different functional structural states for medium to large proteins (200-450 aa) belonging to several distinct families. The combination of direct coupling analysis and the structure-based model also predicts several intermediates or hidden states that are of functional importance. This enhanced sampling is broadly applicable and has direct implications in protein structure determination and the design of ligands or drugs to trap intermediate states.},

abstract = {Allelic imbalance (AI) is a phenomenon where the two alleles of a given gene are expressed at different levels in a given cell, either because of epigenetic inactivation of one of the two alleles, or because of genetic variation in regulatory regions. Recently, Bing et al. have described the use of genotyping arrays to assay AI at a high resolution (approximately 750,000 SNPs across the autosomes). In this paper, we investigate computational approaches to analyze this data and identify genomic regions with AI in an unbiased and robust statistical manner. We propose two families of approaches: (i) a statistical approach based on z-score computations, and (ii) a family of machine learning approaches based on Hidden Markov Models. Each method is evaluated using previously published experimental data sets as well as with permutation testing. When applied to whole genome data from 53 HapMap samples, our approaches reveal that allelic imbalance is widespread (most expressed genes show evidence of AI in at least one of our 53 samples) and that most AI regions in a given individual are also found in at least a few other individuals. While many AI regions identified in the genome correspond to known protein-coding transcripts, others overlap with recently discovered long non-coding RNAs. We also observe that genomic regions with AI not only include complete transcripts with consistent differential expression levels, but also more complex patterns of allelic expression such as alternative promoters and alternative 3' end. The approaches developed not only shed light on the incidence and mechanisms of allelic expression, but will also help towards mapping the genetic causes of allelic expression and identify cases where this variation may be linked to diseases.},

@article{Artigas:2003a,
abstract = {The Na+/K+ pump is a ubiquitous P-type ATPase that binds three cytoplasmic Na+ ions deep within its core where they are temporarily occluded before being released to the extracellular surface. The 3Na+/2K+ -exchange transport cycle is completed when two extracellular K+ ions bind and become temporarily occluded within the protein and subsequently released to the cytoplasm. Coupling of Na+ -ion occlusion to phosphorylation of the pump by ATP and of K+ -ion occlusion to its dephosphorylation ensure the vectorial nature of net transport. The occluded-ion conformations, with binding sites inaccessible from either side, represent intermediate states in these alternating-access descriptions of transport. They afford protection against potentially catastrophic effects of inadvertently allowing simultaneous access from both membrane sides. The marine toxin, palytoxin, converts Na+/K+ pumps into nonselective cation channels, possibly by disrupting the normal strict coupling between opening of one access pathway in the Na+/K+ ATPase and closing of the other. We show here that gating of the channels in palytoxin-bound Na+/K+ pumps in excised membrane patches is modulated by the pump's physiological ligands: cytoplasmic application of ATP promotes opening of the channels, and extracellular replacement of Na+ ions by K+ ions promotes closing of the channels. This suggests that, despite the presence of bound palytoxin, certain partial reactions of the normal Na+/K+ -transport cycle persist and remain capable of effecting the conformational changes that control access to the pump's cation-binding sites. These findings affirm the alternating-access model of ion pumps and offer the possibility of examining ion occlusion/deocclusion reactions in single pump molecules.},

abstract = {Polyketides, a diverse group of heteropolymers with antibiotic and antitumor properties, are assembled in bacteria by multiprotein chains of modular polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins. Specific protein-protein interactions determine the order of proteins within a multiprotein chain, and thereby the order in which chemically distinct monomers are added to the growing polyketide product. Here we investigate the evolutionary and molecular origins of protein interaction specificity. We focus on the short, conserved N- and C-terminal docking domains that mediate interactions between modular PKS proteins. Our computational analysis, which combines protein sequence data with experimental protein interaction data, reveals a hierarchical interaction specificity code. PKS docking domains are descended from a single ancestral interacting pair, but have split into three phylogenetic classes that are mutually noninteracting. Specificity within one such compatibility class is determined by a few key residues, which can be used to define compatibility subclasses. We identify these residues using a novel, highly sensitive co-evolution detection algorithm called CRoSS (correlated residues of statistical significance). The residue pairs selected by CRoSS are involved in direct physical interactions in a docked-domain NMR structure. A single PKS system can use docking domain pairs from multiple classes, as well as domain pairs from multiple subclasses of any given class. The termini of individual proteins are frequently shuffled, but docking domain pairs straddling two interacting proteins are linked as an evolutionary module. The hierarchical and modular organization of the specificity code is intimately related to the processes by which bacteria generate new PKS pathways.},

Mutations in two high-risk susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, along with rare intermediate-risk genes and common low-penetrance alleles identified, altogether explain no more than 45{\%} of the high-risk breast cancer families, although the majority of cases are unaccounted for and are designated as BRCAX tumours. Micro RNAs have called great attention for classification of different cancer types and have been implicated in a range of important biological processes and are deregulated in cancer pathogenesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Here we have performed an exploratory hypothesis-generating study of miRNA expression profiles in a large series of 66 primary hereditary breast tumours by microarray analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Unsupervised clustering analysis of miRNA molecular profiles revealed distinct subgroups of BRCAX tumours, 'normal-like' BRCAX-A, 'proliferative' BRCAX-B, 'BRCA1/2-like' BRCAX-C and 'undefined' BRCAX-D subgroup. These findings introduce a new insight in the biology of hereditary breast cancer, defining specific BRCAX subgroups, which could help in the search for novel susceptibility pathways in hereditary breast cancer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that BRCAX hereditary breast tumours can be sub-classified into four previously unknown homogenous groups characterised by specific miRNA expression signatures and histopathological features.},

abstract = {Exocytosis of secretory or synaptic vesicles is executed by a mechanism including the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins. Munc18-1 is a part of this fusion machinery, but its role is controversial because it is indispensable for fusion but also inhibits the assembly of purified SNAREs in vitro. This inhibition reflects the binding of Munc18-1 to a closed conformation of the target-SNARE syntaxin1. The controversy would be solved if binding to closed syntaxin1 were shown to be stimulatory for vesicle fusion and/or additional essential interactions were identified between Munc18-1 and the fusion machinery. Here, we provide evidence for both notions by dissecting sequential steps of the exocytotic cascade while expressing Munc18 variants in the Munc18-1 null background. In Munc18-1 null chromaffin cells, vesicle docking is abolished and syntaxin levels are reduced. A mutation that diminished Munc18 binding to syntaxin1 in vitro attenuated the vesicle-docking step but rescued vesicle priming in excess of docking. Conversely, expressing the Munc18-2 isoform, which also displays binding to closed syntaxin1, rescued vesicle docking identical with Munc18-1 but impaired more downstream vesicle priming steps. All Munc18 variants restored syntaxin1 levels at least to wild-type levels, showing that the docking phenotype is not caused by syntaxin1 reduction. None of the Munc18 variants affected vesicle fusion kinetics or fusion pore duration. In conclusion, binding of Munc18-1 to closed syntaxin1 stimulates vesicle docking and a distinct interaction mode regulates the consecutive priming step.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) constitute more than 90{\%} of the genetic variation, and hence can account for most trait differences among individuals in a given species. Polymorphism detection software PolyBayes and PolyPhred give high false positive SNP predictions even with stringent parameter values. We developed a machine learning (ML) method to augment PolyBayes to improve its prediction accuracy. ML methods have also been successfully applied to other bioinformatics problems in predicting genes, promoters, transcription factor binding sites and protein structures. RESULTS: The ML program C4.5 was applied to a set of features in order to build a SNP classifier from training data based on human expert decisions (True/False). The training data were 27,275 candidate SNP generated by sequencing 1973 STS (sequence tag sites) (12 Mb) in both directions from 6 diverse homozygous soybean cultivars and PolyBayes analysis. Test data of 18,390 candidate SNP were generated similarly from 1359 additional STS (8 Mb). SNP from both sets were classified by experts. After training the ML classifier, it agreed with the experts on 97.3{\%} of test data compared with 7.8{\%} agreement between PolyBayes and experts. The PolyBayes positive predictive values (PPV) (i.e., fraction of candidate SNP being real) were 7.8{\%} for all predictions and 16.7{\%} for those with 100{\%} posterior probability of being real. Using ML improved the PPV to 84.8{\%}, a 5- to 10-fold increase. While both ML and PolyBayes produced a similar number of true positives, the ML program generated only 249 false positives as compared to 16,955 for PolyBayes. The complexity of the soybean genome may have contributed to high false SNP predictions by PolyBayes and hence results may differ for other genomes. CONCLUSION: A machine learning (ML) method was developed as a supplementary feature to the polymorphism detection software for improving prediction accuracies. The results from this study indicate that a trained ML classifier can significantly reduce human intervention and in this case achieved a 5-10 fold enhanced productivity. The optimized feature set and ML framework can also be applied to all polymorphism discovery software. ML support software is written in Perl and can be easily integrated into an existing SNP discovery pipeline.},

Human genetic population-based studies have identified numerous heritable sequence and structural genomic variants associated with susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disease. However, these germline variants do not fully account for disease risk. During brain development, progenitor cells undergo billions of cell divisions to generate the {\~{}}80 billion neurons in the brain. The failure to accurately repair DNA damage arising during replication, transcription, and cellular metabolism amid this dramatic cellular expansion can lead to somatic mutations. Somatic mutations that alter subsets of neuronal transcriptomes and proteomes can, in turn, affect cell proliferation and survival and lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. The long life span of individual neurons and the direct relationship between neural circuits and behavior suggest that somatic mutations in small populations of neurons can significantly affect individual neurodevelopment. The Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network has been founded to study somatic mosaicism both in neurotypical human brains and in the context of complex neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Here we propose a novel method for inferring causality that is no longer constrained by the conditional dependency arguments that limit the ability of statistical causal inference methods to resolve causal relationships within sets of graphical models that are Markov equivalent. Our method utilizes Bayesian belief propagation to infer the responses of perturbation events on molecular traits given a hypothesized graph structure. A distance measure between the inferred response distribution and the observed data is defined to assess the 'fitness' of the hypothesized causal relationships. To test our algorithm, we infer causal relationships within equivalence classes of gene networks in which the form of the functional interactions that are possible are assumed to be nonlinear, given synthetic microarray and RNA sequencing data. We also apply our method to infer causality in real metabolic network with v-structure and feedback loop. We show that our method can recapitulate the causal structure and recover the feedback loop only from steady-state data which conventional method cannot.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Statistical phylogenetics is computationally intensive, resulting in considerable attention meted on techniques for parallelization. Codon-based models allow for independent rates of synonymous and replacement substitutions and have the potential to more adequately model the process of protein-coding sequence evolution with a resulting increase in phylogenetic accuracy. Unfortunately, due to the high number of codon states, computational burden has largely thwarted phylogenetic reconstruction under codon models, particularly at the genomic-scale. Here, we describe novel algorithms and methods for evaluating phylogenies under arbitrary molecular evolutionary models on graphics processing units (GPUs), making use of the large number of processing cores to efficiently parallelize calculations even for large state-size models. RESULTS: We implement the approach in an existing Bayesian framework and apply the algorithms to estimating the phylogeny of 62 complete mitochondrial genomes of carnivores under a 60-state codon model. We see a near 90-fold speed increase over an optimized CPU-based computation and a {\textgreater}140-fold increase over the currently available implementation, making this the first practical use of codon models for phylogenetic inference over whole mitochondrial or microorganism genomes.

We describe a simple, yet elegant, solution to assess the biological accuracy of alignments automatically. Our approach is based on the comparison of several alignments of the same sequences. We introduce two functions to compare alignments: the average overlap score and the multiple overlap score. The former identifies difficult alignment cases by expressing the similarity among several alignments, while the latter estimates the biological correctness of individual alignments. We implemented both functions in the MUMSA program and demonstrate the overall robustness and accuracy of both functions on three large benchmark sets.},

abstract = {While there have been studies exploring regulatory variation in one or more tissues, the complexity of tissue-specificity in multiple primary tissues is not yet well understood. We explore in depth the role of cis-regulatory variation in three human tissues: lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), skin, and fat. The samples (156 LCL, 160 skin, 166 fat) were derived simultaneously from a subset of well-phenotyped healthy female twins of the MuTHER resource. We discover an abundance of cis-eQTLs in each tissue similar to previous estimates (858 or 4.7{\%} of genes). In addition, we apply factor analysis (FA) to remove effects of latent variables, thus more than doubling the number of our discoveries (1,822 eQTL genes). The unique study design (Matched Co-Twin Analysis--MCTA) permits immediate replication of eQTLs using co-twins (93{\%}-98{\%}) and validation of the considerable gain in eQTL discovery after FA correction. We highlight the challenges of comparing eQTLs between tissues. After verifying previous significance threshold-based estimates of tissue-specificity, we show their limitations given their dependency on statistical power. We propose that continuous estimates of the proportion of tissue-shared signals and direct comparison of the magnitude of effect on the fold change in expression are essential properties that jointly provide a biologically realistic view of tissue-specificity. Under this framework we demonstrate that 30{\%} of eQTLs are shared among the three tissues studied, while another 29{\%} appear exclusively tissue-specific. However, even among the shared eQTLs, a substantial proportion (10{\%}-20{\%}) have significant differences in the magnitude of fold change between genotypic classes across tissues. Our results underline the need to account for the complexity of eQTL tissue-specificity in an effort to assess consequences of such variants for complex traits.},

abstract = {ABC (ATP-binding cassette) proteins constitute a large family of membrane proteins that actively transport a broad range of substrates. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the protein dysfunctional in cystic fibrosis, is unique among ABC proteins in that its transmembrane domains comprise an ion channel. Opening and closing of the pore have been linked to ATP binding and hydrolysis at CFTR's two nucleotide-binding domains, NBD1 and NBD2 (see, for example, refs 1, 2). Isolated NBDs of prokaryotic ABC proteins dimerize upon binding ATP, and hydrolysis of the ATP causes dimer dissociation. Here, using single-channel recording methods on intact CFTR molecules, we directly follow opening and closing of the channel gates, and relate these occurrences to ATP-mediated events in the NBDs. We find that energetic coupling between two CFTR residues, expected to lie on opposite sides of its predicted NBD1-NBD2 dimer interface, changes in concert with channel gating status. The two monitored side chains are independent of each other in closed channels but become coupled as the channels open. The results directly link ATP-driven tight dimerization of CFTR's cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains to opening of the ion channel in the transmembrane domains. This establishes a molecular mechanism, involving dynamic restructuring of the NBD dimer interface, that is probably common to all members of the ABC protein superfamily.},

abstract = {The Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels mediate fast synaptic transmission for communication between neurons. They are allosteric proteins, in which binding of a neurotransmitter to its binding site in the extracellular amino-terminal domain triggers structural changes in distant transmembrane domains to open a channel for ion flow. Although the locations of binding site and channel gating machinery are well defined, the structural basis of the activation pathway coupling binding and channel opening remains to be determined. In this paper, by analyzing amino acid covariance in a multiple sequence alignment, we have identified an energetically interconnected network in the Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. Statistical coupling and correlated mutational analyses along with clustering revealed a highly coupled cluster. Mapping the positions in the cluster onto a three-dimensional structural model demonstrated that these highly coupled positions form an interconnected network linking experimentally identified binding domains through the coupling region to the gating machinery. In addition, these highly coupled positions are also condensed in the transmembrane domains, which are a recent focus for the sites of action of many allosteric modulators. Thus, our results revealed a genetically interconnected network that potentially plays an important role in the allosteric activation and modulation of the Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels.},

Here, we introduce a general framework, based on factor graphs, for constructing probabilistic models of protein evolution with site interdependence. Conveniently, efficient approximate inference algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, can be used to calculate likelihoods for these models. We fit an amino acid substitution model of this type that accounts for both solvent accessibility and site-site correlations. Comparisons of the new model with rate matrix models and alternative structure-dependent models demonstrate that it better fits the sequence data. We also examine evolution within a family of homohexameric enzymes and find that site-site correlations between most contacting subunits contribute to a higher likelihood. In addition, we show that the new substitution model has a similar mathematical form to the one introduced in Rodrigue et al. (Rodrigue N, Lartillot N, Bryant D, Philippe H. 2005. Site interdependence attributed to tertiary structure in amino acid sequence evolution. Gene 347:207-217), although with different parameter interpretations and values. We also perform a statistical analysis of the effects of amino acids at neighboring sites on substitution probabilities and find a significant perturbation of most probabilities, further supporting the significant role of site-site interactions in protein evolution and motivating the development of new evolutionary models similar to the one described here. Finally, we discuss possible extensions and applications of the new substitution model.},

abstract = {Somatic cells acquire mutations throughout the course of an individual's life. Mutations occurring early in embryogenesis are often present in a substantial proportion of, but not all, cells in postnatal humans and thus have particular characteristics and effects. Depending on their location in the genome and the proportion of cells they are present in, these mosaic mutations can cause a wide range of genetic disease syndromes and predispose carriers to cancer. They have a high chance of being transmitted to offspring as de novo germline mutations and, in principle, can provide insights into early human embryonic cell lineages and their contributions to adult tissues. Although it is known that gross chromosomal abnormalities are remarkably common in early human embryos, our understanding of early embryonic somatic mutations is very limited. Here we use whole-genome sequences of normal blood from 241 adults to identify 163 early embryonic mutations. We estimate that approximately three base substitution mutations occur per cell per cell-doubling event in early human embryogenesis and these are mainly attributable to two known mutational signatures. We used the mutations to reconstruct developmental lineages of adult cells and demonstrate that the two daughter cells of many early embryonic cell-doubling events contribute asymmetrically to adult blood at an approximately 2:1 ratio. This study therefore provides insights into the mutation rates, mutational processes and developmental outcomes of cell dynamics that operate during early human embryogenesis.},

abstract = {Normal mammalian development requires a maternal and paternal contribution, which is attributed to imprinted genes, or genes that are expressed from a single parental allele. Approximately 100 imprinted genes have been reported in mammals thus far. Imprinted genes are controlled by cis-acting regulatory elements, termed imprinting control regions (ICRs), which have parental-specific epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation. ICRs are methylated by de novo DNA methyltransferases during germline development; these parental-specific modifications must be maintained following fertilization when the genome is extensively reprogrammed. Many imprinted genes reside in ∼1-megabase clusters, with two major mechanisms of imprinting regulation currently recognized, CTCF-dependent insulators and long noncoding RNAs. Unclustered imprinted genes are generally regulated by germline-derived differential promoter methylation. Here, we describe the identification and functions of imprinted genes, cis-acting control sequences, trans-acting factors, and imprinting mechanisms in clusters. Finally, we define questions that require more extensive research.},

abstract = {Biomolecular systems possess unique, structure-encoded dynamic properties that underlie their biological functions. Recent studies indicate that these dynamic properties are determined to a large extent by the topology of native contacts. In recent years, elastic network models used in conjunction with normal mode analyses have proven to be useful for elucidating the collective dynamics intrinsically accessible under native state conditions, including in particular the global modes of motions that are robustly defined by the overall architecture. With increasing availability of structural data for well-studied proteins in different forms (liganded, complexed, or free), there is increasing evidence in support of the correspondence between functional changes in structures observed in experiments and the global motions predicted by these coarse-grained analyses. These observed correlations suggest that computational methods may be advantageously employed for assessing functional changes in structure and allosteric mechanisms intrinsically favored by the native fold.},

abstract = {The ATPase components of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters power the transporters by binding and hydrolyzing ATP. Major conformational changes of an ATPase are revealed by crystal structures of MalK, the ATPase subunit of the maltose transporter from Escherichia coli, in three different dimeric configurations. While other nucleotide binding domains or subunits display low affinity for each other in the absence of the transmembrane segments, the MalK dimer is stabilized through interactions of the additional C-terminal domains. In the two nucleotide-free structures, the N-terminal nucleotide binding domains are separated to differing degrees, and the dimer is maintained through contacts of the C-terminal regulatory domains. In the ATP-bound form, the nucleotide binding domains make contact and two ATPs lie buried along the dimer interface. The two nucleotide binding domains of the dimer open and close like a pair of tweezers, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for ATPase activity that may be tightly coupled to translocation.},

abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) is a key regulator of inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TNF-$\alpha$ blocker therapies can be very effective for a substantial number of patients, but fail to work in one third of patients who show no or minimal response. It is therefore necessary to discover new molecular intervention points involved in TNF-$\alpha$ blocker treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients. We describe a data analysis strategy for predicting gene expression measures that are critical for rheumatoid arthritis using a combination of comprehensive genotyping, whole blood gene expression profiles and the component clinical measures of the arthritis Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) score. Two separate network ensembles, each comprised of 1024 networks, were built from molecular measures from subjects before and 14 weeks after treatment with TNF-$\alpha$ blocker. The network ensemble built from pre-treated data captures TNF-$\alpha$ dependent mechanistic information, while the ensemble built from data collected under TNF-$\alpha$ blocker treatment captures TNF-$\alpha$ independent mechanisms. In silico simulations of targeted, personalized perturbations of gene expression measures from both network ensembles identify transcripts in three broad categories. Firstly, 22 transcripts are identified to have new roles in modulating the DAS28 score; secondly, there are 6 transcripts that could be alternative targets to TNF-$\alpha$ blocker therapies, including CD86--a component of the signaling axis targeted by Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig), and finally, 59 transcripts that are predicted to modulate the count of tender or swollen joints but not sufficiently enough to have a significant impact on DAS28.},

Based on the correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds in Bayesian tests, and to equate P values with Bayes factors. An examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to 25-50:1, and to 100-200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.},

These alterations are constantly evolving as tumor cells face changing selective pressures induced by the cells themselves, the microenvironment and drug treatments. Tumors are also complex ecosystems where different, sometime heterogeneous, subclonal tumor populations and a variety of nontumor cells coexist in a constantly evolving manner. The interactions between molecules and between cells that arise as a result of these alterations and ecosystems are even more complex. The cancer research community is increasingly embracing this complexity and adopting a combination of systems biology methods and integrated analyses to understand and predictively model the activity of cancer cells. Systems biology approaches are helping to understand the mechanisms of tumor progression and design more effective cancer therapies. These approaches work in tandem with rapid technological advancements that enable data acquisition on a broader scale, with finer accuracy, higher dimensionality and higher throughput than ever. Using such data, computational and mathematical models help identify key deregulated functions and processes, establish predictive biomarkers and optimize therapeutic strategies.

abstract = {Mapping of mutations on a phylogeny has been a commonly used analytical tool in phylogenetics and molecular evolution. However, the common approaches for mapping mutations based on parsimony have lacked a solid statistical foundation. Here, I present a Bayesian method for mapping mutations on a phylogeny. I illustrate some of the common problems associated with using parsimony and suggest instead that inferences in molecular evolution can be made on the basis of the posterior distribution of the mappings of mutations. A method for simulating a mapping from the posterior distribution of mappings is also presented, and the utility of the method is illustrated on two previously published data sets. Applications include a method for testing for variation in the substitution rate along the sequence and a method for testing whether the d(N)/d(S) ratio varies among lineages in the phylogeny.},

An analysis of human disorders of imprinted genes suggests genes of paternal origin, expressed in infants, have been selected to favor more intense suckling than genes of maternal origin. The same analysis suggests that genes of maternal origin may favor slower childhood growth but earlier sexual maturation. These observations are consistent with a hypothesis in which slow maturation was an adaptation of offspring that reduced maternal fitness, whereas early weaning was an adaptation of mothers that reduced the fitness of individual offspring.},

The aim of this study was to validate the accuracy and sensitivity of our method for comprehensive mutation detection in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We assessed the performance of the bench-top Ion Torrent PGM and Illumina MiSeq platforms as optimized solutions for mutation detection, using microdroplet PCR-based enrichment of 62 ASD associated genes. Ten patients with known mutations were sequenced using NGS to validate the sensitivity of our method. The overall read quality was better with MiSeq, largely because of the increased indel-related error associated with PGM. The sensitivity of SNV detection was similar between the two platforms, suggesting they are both suitable for SNV detection in the human genome. Next, we used these methods to analyze 28 patients with ASD, and identified 22 novel variants in genes associated with ASD, with one mutation detected by MiSeq only. Thus, our results support the combination of target gene enrichment and NGS as a valuable molecular method for investigating rare variants in ASD.},

Here we introduce network-based stratification (NBS), a method to integrate somatic tumor genomes with gene networks. This approach allows for stratification of cancer into informative subtypes by clustering together patients with mutations in similar network regions. We demonstrate NBS in ovarian, uterine and lung cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For each tissue, NBS identifies subtypes that are predictive of clinical outcomes such as patient survival, response to therapy or tumor histology. We identify network regions characteristic of each subtype and show how mutation-derived subtypes can be used to train an mRNA expression signature, which provides similar information in the absence of DNA sequence.},

@article{Csanady:2005,
abstract = {CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), the protein whose dysfunction causes cystic fibrosis, is a chloride ion channel whose gating is controlled by interactions of MgATP with CFTR's two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domains, but only after several serines in CFTR's regulatory (R) domain have been phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Whereas eight R-domain serines have previously been shown to be phosphorylated in purified CFTR, it is not known how individual phosphoserines regulate channel gating, although two of them, at positions 737 and 768, have been suggested to be inhibitory. Here we show, using mass spectrometric analysis, that Ser 768 is the first site phosphorylated in purified R-domain protein, and that it and five other R-domain sites are already phosphorylated in resting Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type (WT) human epithelial CFTR. The WT channels have lower activity than S768A channels (with Ser 768 mutated to Ala) in resting oocytes, confirming the inhibitory influence of phosphoserine 768. In excised patches exposed to a range of PKA concentrations, the open probability (P(o)) of mutant S768A channels exceeded that of WT CFTR channels at all [PKA], and the half-maximally activating [PKA] for WT channels was twice that for S768A channels. As the open burst duration of S768A CFTR channels was almost double that of WT channels, at both low (55 nM) and high (550 nM) [PKA], we conclude that the principal mechanism by which phosphoserine 768 inhibits WT CFTR is by hastening the termination of open channel bursts. The right-shifted P(o)-[PKA] curve of WT channels might explain their slower activation, compared with S768A channels, at low [PKA]. The finding that phosphorylation kinetics of WT or S768A R-domain peptides were similar provides no support for an alternative explanation, that early phosphorylation of Ser 768 in WT CFTR might also impair subsequent phosphorylation of stimulatory R-domain serines. The observed reduced sensitivity to activation by [PKA] imparted by Ser 768 might serve to ensure activation of WT CFTR by strong stimuli while dampening responses to weak signals.},

abstract = {We have developed a new approach to characterize allele-specific timing of DNA replication genome-wide in human primary basophilic erythroblasts. We show that the two chromosome homologs replicate at the same time in about 88{\%} of the genome and that large structural variants are preferentially associated with asynchronous replication. We identified about 600 megabase-sized asynchronously replicated domains in two tested individuals. The longest asynchronously replicated domains are enriched in imprinted genes suggesting that structural variants and parental imprinting are two causes of replication asynchrony in the human genome. Biased chromosome X inactivation in one of the two individuals tested was another source of detectable replication asynchrony. Analysis of high-resolution TimEX profiles revealed small variations termed timing ripples, which were undetected in previous, lower resolution analyses. Timing ripples reflect highly reproducible, variations of the timing of replication in the 100 kb-range that exist within the well-characterized megabase-sized replication timing domains. These ripples correspond to clusters of origins of replication that we detected using novel nascent strands DNA profiling methods. Analysis of the distribution of replication origins revealed dramatic differences in initiation of replication frequencies during S phase and a strong association, in both synchronous and asynchronous regions, between origins of replication and three genomic features: G-quadruplexes, CpG Islands and transcription start sites. The frequency of initiation in asynchronous regions was similar in the two homologs. Asynchronous regions were richer in origins of replication than synchronous regions.},

abstract = {Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play a fundamental role in eukaryotic signaling. Some 30{\%} of proteins are phosphorylated at any time, many on multiple sites, raising the question of how the cellular phosphorylation state is regulated. Previous work for one and two phosphorylation sites has revealed mechanisms, such as distributive phosphorylation, for switch-like regulation of maximally phosphorylated phosphoforms. These insights have led to the influential view that more phosphorylation sites leads to steeper switching, as proposed for substrates like cyclin E and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1. An analytical study of the ordered distributive case reveals a more complex story. Multisite phosphorylation creates an efficient threshold: The proportion of maximally phosphorylated substrate is maintained close to 0 when the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity lies below a suitable threshold, and this threshold increases with increasing numbers of sites, n. However, above the threshold, the response may not always abruptly switch between 0 and 1, as would be the case for an efficient switch, but may increase in a gradual manner, which becomes more hyperbolic with increasing n. Abrupt switching cannot be attributed merely to n being large. We point out that conventional measures of ultrasensitivity must be modified to discriminate between thresholding and switching; we discuss additional factors that influence switching efficiency and suggest new directions for experimental investigation.},

We found 32 somatic non-synonymous coding mutations present in the metastasis, and measured the frequency of these somatic mutations in DNA from the primary tumour of the same patient, which arose 9 years earlier. Five of the 32 mutations (in ABCB11, HAUS3, SLC24A4, SNX4 and PALB2) were prevalent in the DNA of the primary tumour removed at diagnosis 9 years earlier, six (in KIF1C, USP28, MYH8, MORC1, KIAA1468 and RNASEH2A) were present at lower frequencies (1-13{\%}), 19 were not detected in the primary tumour, and two were undetermined. The combined analysis of genome and transcriptome data revealed two new RNA-editing events that recode the amino acid sequence of SRP9 and COG3. Taken together, our data show that single nucleotide mutational heterogeneity can be a property of low or intermediate grade primary breast cancers and that significant evolution can occur with disease progression.},

abstract = {Our previous mathematical model of solute-coupled water transport through the intestinal epithelium is extended for dealing with electrolytes rather than electroneutral solutes. A 3Na+-2K+ pump in the lateral membranes provides the energy-requiring step for driving transjunctional and translateral flows of water across the epithelium with recirculation of the diffusible ions maintained by a 1Na+-1K+-2Cl- cotransporter in the plasma membrane facing the serosal compartment. With intracellular non-diffusible anions and compliant plasma membranes, the model describes the dependence on membrane permeabilities and pump constants of fluxes of water and electrolytes, volumes and ion concentrations of cell and lateral intercellular space (lis), and membrane potentials and conductances. Simulating physiological bioelectrical features together with cellular and paracellular fluxes of the sodium ion, computations predict that the concentration differences between lis and bathing solutions are small for all three ions. Nevertheless, the diffusion fluxes of the ions out of lis significantly exceed their mass transports. It is concluded that isotonic transport requires recirculation of all three ions. The computed sodium recirculation flux that is required for isotonic transport corresponds to that estimated in experiments on toad small intestine. This result is shown to be robust and independent of whether the apical entrance mechanism for the sodium ion is a channel, a SGLT1 transporter driving inward uphill water flux, or an electroneutral Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter.},

abstract = {Psoriasis, an immune-mediated, inflammatory disease of the skin and joints, provides an ideal system for expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, because it has a strong genetic basis and disease-relevant tissue (skin) is readily accessible. To better understand the role of genetic variants regulating cutaneous gene expression, we identified 841 cis-acting eQTLs using RNA extracted from skin biopsies of 53 psoriatic individuals and 57 healthy controls. We found substantial overlap between cis-eQTLs of normal control, uninvolved psoriatic, and lesional psoriatic skin. Consistent with recent studies and with the idea that control of gene expression can mediate relationships between genetic variants and disease risk, we found that eQTL SNPs are more likely to be associated with psoriasis than are randomly selected SNPs. To explore the tissue specificity of these eQTLs and hence to quantify the benefits of studying eQTLs in different tissues, we developed a refined statistical method for estimating eQTL overlap and used it to compare skin eQTLs to a published panel of lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) eQTLs. Our method accounts for the fact that most eQTL studies are likely to miss some true eQTLs as a result of power limitations and shows that ???70{\%} of cis-eQTLs in LCLs are shared with skin, as compared with the naive estimate of {\textless} 50{\%} sharing. Our results provide a useful method for estimating the overlap between various eQTL studies and provide a catalog of cis-eQTLs in skin that can facilitate efforts to understand the functional impact of identified susceptibility variants on psoriasis and other skin traits. ?? 2010 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

@article{Nei:2005fk,
abstract = {Charles Darwin proposed that evolution occurs primarily by natural selection, but this view has been controversial from the beginning. Two of the major opposing views have been mutationism and neutralism. Early molecular studies suggested that most amino acid substitutions in proteins are neutral or nearly neutral and the functional change of proteins occurs by a few key amino acid substitutions. This suggestion generated an intense controversy over selectionism and neutralism. This controversy is partially caused by Kimura's definition of neutrality, which was too strict (|2Ns|{\textless} or =1). If we define neutral mutations as the mutations that do not change the function of gene products appreciably, many controversies disappear because slightly deleterious and slightly advantageous mutations are engulfed by neutral mutations. The ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution to that of synonymous substitution is a useful quantity to study positive Darwinian selection operating at highly variable genetic loci, but it does not necessarily detect adaptively important codons. Previously, multigene families were thought to evolve following the model of concerted evolution, but new evidence indicates that most of them evolve by a birth-and-death process of duplicate genes. It is now clear that most phenotypic characters or genetic systems such as the adaptive immune system in vertebrates are controlled by the interaction of a number of multigene families, which are often evolutionarily related and are subject to birth-and-death evolution. Therefore, it is important to study the mechanisms of gene family interaction for understanding phenotypic evolution. Because gene duplication occurs more or less at random, phenotypic evolution contains some fortuitous elements, though the environmental factors also play an important role. The randomness of phenotypic evolution is qualitatively different from allele frequency changes by random genetic drift. However, there is some similarity between phenotypic and molecular evolution with respect to functional or environmental constraints and evolutionary rate. It appears that mutation (including gene duplication and other DNA changes) is the driving force of evolution at both the genic and the phenotypic levels.},

  abstract      = {Members of the ABCC sub-family of ABC transport proteins underlie insulin secretion, multidrug resistance in some cancers, and cystic fibrosis disease; unlike most other ABC proteins, they are characterized by two markedly dissimilar ATP binding sites. Recent X-ray structures illuminate numerous inter-residue interactions but it remains largely unknown which interactions are crucial for the signal transduction events that mediate conformational changes during transport. We have inferred such interactions by detecting coevolving pairs of amino-acid positions from aligned ABCC protein sequences using several current methods, which vary in their correction for phylogenetic relatedness, and their assumptions about how amino-acid substitutions occur. We evaluated the performance of these methods by testing their ability to predict side-chain contacts given a 3D structural model. Since the heterogeneity of amino-acid substitution rates generates correlations between positions and thus undermines accurate detection of coevolving pairs, we partitioned pairs into classes based on the rate of amino-acid substitutions at both positions of each pair. We then optimized the performance of the methods in three sequential steps: removal of the most redundant sequences from the alignment to correct for phylogenetic artifacts, logical combination of methods in proportion to their individual performances, and adjustment of the coevolution score of each pair according to the performance associated with that pair's substitution rate class. We verified that performance was improved by these procedures, in comparison to results obtained with each method separately and without partitioning pairs by substitution rate. As expected, many of the detected coevolving pairs bridge consecutive turns in alpha-helices in the structural model. Others, however, link distinct structural elements or domains, and so might transduce signals during the protein's conformational cycle. Intriguingly, some of the positions identified have been implicated in cystic fibrosis.

Such constraints can have multiple origins, in this work we present a model for constrained evolutionary trajectories represented by a markovian process throughout a set of protein-like structures artificially constructed to be topological intermediates between the structure of two natural occurring proteins. The number and type of intermediate steps defines how constrained the total evolutionary process is. By using a coarse-grained representation for the protein structures, we derive an analytic formulation of the transition rates between each of the intermediate structures. The results indicate that compact structures with a high number of hydrogen bonds are more probable and have a higher likelihood to arise during evolution. Knowledge of the transition rates allows for the study of complex evolutionary pathways represented by trajectories through a set of intermediate structures.},

Previous studies suggest that cysteines of a disulfide bond mutate in a correlated manner. RESULTS: We developed a method that analyzes correlated mutation patterns in multiple sequence alignments in order to predict disulfide bond connectivity. Proteins with known experimental structures and varying numbers of disulfide bonds, and that spanned various evolutionary distances, were aligned. We observed frequent variation of disulfide bond connectivity within members of the same protein families, and it was also observed that in 99{\%} of the cases, cysteine pairs forming non-conserved disulfide bonds mutated in concert. Our data support the notion that substitution of a cysteine in a disulfide bond prompts the substitution of its cysteine partner and that oxidized cysteines appear in pairs. The method we developed predicts disulfide bond connectivity patterns with accuracies of 73, 69 and 61{\%} for proteins with two, three and four disulfide bonds, respectively.},

abstract = {The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recently issued recommendations for reporting incidental findings from clinical whole-genome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing. The recommendations call for evaluating a specific set of genes as part of all whole-genome sequencing/whole-exome sequencing and reporting all pathogenic variants irrespective of patient age. The genes are associated with highly penetrant disorders for which treatment or prevention is available. The effort to generate a list of genes with actionable findings is commendable, but the recommendations raise several concerns. They constitute a call for opportunistic screening, through intentional effort to identify pathogenic variants in specified genes unrelated to the clinical concern that prompted testing. Yet for most of the genes, we lack evidence about the predictive value of testing, genotype penetrance, spectrum of phenotypes, and efficacy of interventions in unselected populations. Furthermore, the recommendations do not allow patients to decline the additional findings, a position inconsistent with established norms. Finally, the recommendation to return adult-onset disease findings when children are tested is inconsistent with current professional consensus, including other policy statements of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Instead of premature practice recommendations, we call for robust dialogue among stakeholders to define a pathway to normatively sound, evidence-based guidelines.$\backslash$nGenet Med 15 11, 854–859.$\backslash$nView full text},

abstract = {It has been estimated that about 30{\%} of the genes in the human genome are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). These are short RNA sequences that can down-regulate the levels of mRNAs or proteins in animals and plants. Genes regulated by miRNAs are called targets. Typically, methods for target prediction are based solely on sequence data and on the structure information. In this paper we propose a Bayesian graphical modeling approach that infers the miRNA regulatory network by integrating expression levels of miRNAs with their potential mRNA targets and, via the prior probability model, with their sequence/structure information. We use a directed graphical model with a particular structure adapted to our data based on biological considerations. We then achieve network inference using stochastic search methods for variable selection that allow us to explore the huge model space via MCMC. A time-dependent coefficients model is also implemented. We consider experimental data from a study on a very well-known developmental toxicant causing neural tube defects, hyperthermia. Some of the pairs of target gene and miRNA we identify seem very plausible and warrant future investigation. Our proposed method is general and can be easily applied to other types of network inference by integrating multiple data sources.},

abstract = {Fossils of organisms dating from the origin and diversification of cellular life are scant and difficult to interpret, for this reason alternative means to investigate the ecology of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) and of the ancestors of the three domains of life are of great scientific value. It was recently recognized that the effects of temperature on ancestral organisms left 'genetic footprints' that could be uncovered in extant genomes. Accordingly, analyses of resurrected proteins predicted that the bacterial ancestor was thermophilic and that Bacteria subsequently adapted to lower temperatures. As the archaeal ancestor is also thought to have been thermophilic, the LUCA was parsimoniously inferred as thermophilic too. However, an analysis of ribosomal RNAs supported the hypothesis of a non-hyperthermophilic LUCA. Here we show that both rRNA and protein sequences analysed with advanced, realistic models of molecular evolution provide independent support for two environmental-temperature-related phases during the evolutionary history of the tree of life. In the first period, thermotolerance increased from a mesophilic LUCA to thermophilic ancestors of Bacteria and of Archaea-Eukaryota; in the second period, it decreased. Therefore, the two lineages descending from the LUCA and leading to the ancestors of Bacteria and Archaea-Eukaryota convergently adapted to high temperatures, possibly in response to a climate change of the early Earth, and/or aided by the transition from an RNA genome in the LUCA to organisms with more thermostable DNA genomes. This analysis unifies apparently contradictory results into a coherent depiction of the evolution of an ecological trait over the entire tree of life.},

Parametric bootstrap tests indicate that the solvent accessibility status of a site has a particularly strong association with the process of amino acid replacement that it experiences. Significant association between secondary structure environment and the amino acid replacement process is also observed. Careful description of the length distribution of secondary structure elements and of the organization of secondary structure and solvent accessibility along a protein did not always significantly improve the fit of the evolutionary models to the data sets that were analyzed. As indicated by the strength of the association of both solvent accessibility and secondary structure with amino acid replacement, the process of protein evolution-both above and below the species level-will not be well understood until the physical constraints that affect protein evolution are identified and characterized.},

Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated construction of probabilistic expert systems. We extend the basic method to handle missing data and hidden (latent) variables. We show how to perform probabilistic inference by averaging over the inferences of multiple belief networks. Results are presented of a preliminary evaluation of an algorithm for constructing a belief network from a database of cases. Finally, we relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying differentially expressed genes (DEG) is a fundamental step in studies that perform genome wide expression profiling. Typically, DEG are identified by univariate approaches such as Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) or Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) for processing cDNA microarrays, and differential gene expression analysis based on the negative binomial distribution (DESeq) or Empirical analysis of Digital Gene Expression data in R (edgeR) for RNA-seq profiling.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present a new geometrical multivariate approach to identify DEG called the Characteristic Direction. We demonstrate that the Characteristic Direction method is significantly more sensitive than existing methods for identifying DEG in the context of transcription factor (TF) and drug perturbation responses over a large number of microarray experiments. We also benchmarked the Characteristic Direction method using synthetic data, as well as RNA-Seq data. A large collection of microarray expression data from TF perturbations (73 experiments) and drug perturbations (130 experiments) extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), as well as an RNA-Seq study that profiled genome-wide gene expression and STAT3 DNA binding in two subtypes of diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma, were used for benchmarking the method using real data. ChIP-Seq data identifying DNA binding sites of the perturbed TFs, as well as known drug targets of the perturbing drugs, were used as prior knowledge silver-standard for validation. In all cases the Characteristic Direction DEG calling method outperformed other methods. We find that when drugs are applied to cells in various contexts, the proteins that interact with the drug-targets are differentially expressed and more of the corresponding genes are discovered by the Characteristic Direction method. In addition, we show that the Characteristic Direction conceptualization can be used to perform improved gene set enrichment analyses when compared with the gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and the hypergeometric test.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The application of the Characteristic Direction method may shed new light on relevant biological mechanisms that would have remained undiscovered by the current state-of-the-art DEG methods. The method is freely accessible via various open source code implementations using four popular programming languages: R, Python, MATLAB and Mathematica, all available at: http://www.maayanlab.net/CD.},

However, whether aberrant L1 retrotransposition occurs in mental disorders is unknown. Here, we report high L1 copy number in schizophrenia. Increased L1 was demonstrated in neurons from prefrontal cortex of patients and in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived neurons containing 22q11 deletions. Whole-genome sequencing revealed brain-specific L1 insertion in patients localized preferentially to synapse- and schizophrenia-related genes. To study the mechanism of L1 transposition, we examined perinatal environmental risk factors for schizophrenia in animal models and observed an increased L1 copy number after immune activation by poly-I:C or epidermal growth factor. These findings suggest that hyperactive retrotransposition of L1 in neurons triggered by environmental and/or genetic risk factors may contribute to the susceptibility and pathophysiology of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {Microarray expression analyses following miRNA transfection/inhibition and, more recently, Argonaute cross-linked immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-seq assays have been used to detect miRNA target sites. CLIP and expression approaches measure differing stages of miRNA functioning-initial binding of the miRNP complex and subsequent message repression. We use nonparametric predictive models to characterize a large number of known target and flanking features, utilizing miRNA transfection, HITS-CLIP, and PAR-CLIP data. In particular, we utilize the precise spatial information provided by CLIP-seq to analyze the predictive effect of target flanking features. We observe distinct target determinants between expression-based and CLIP-based data. Target flanking features such as flanking region conservation are an important AGO-binding determinant-we hypothesize that CLIP experiments have a preference for strongly bound miRNP-target interactions involving adjacent RNA-binding proteins that increase the strength of cross-linking. In contrast, seed-related features are major determinants in expression-based studies, but less so for CLIP-seq studies, and increased miRNA concentrations typical of transfection studies contribute to this difference. While there is a good overlap between miRNA targets detected by miRNA transfection and CLIP-seq, the detection of CLIP-seq targets is largely independent of the level of subsequent mRNA degradation. Also, models built using CLIP-seq data show strong predictive power between independent CLIP-seq data sets, but are not strongly predictive for expression change. Similarly, models built from expression data are not strongly predictive for CLIP-seq data sets, supporting the finding that the determinants of miRNA binding and mRNA degradation differ. Predictive models and results are available at http://servers.binf.ku.dk/antar/.},

One such characteristic is the effective temperature Tsel at which these foldable sequences have been selected in sequence space by evolution. Tsel quantifies the importance of folded-state energetics and structural specificity for molecular evolution. Across all protein families studied, our estimates for Tsel are well below the experimental folding temperatures, indicating that the energy landscapes of natural foldable proteins are strongly funneled toward the native state.},

abstract = {Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel involved in physiological and pathophysiological processes linked to oxidative stress. TRPM2 channels are co-activated by intracellular Ca(2+) and ADP-ribose (ADPR) but also modulated in intact cells by several additional factors. Superfusion of TRPM2-expressing cells with H(2)O(2) or intracellular dialysis of cyclic ADPR (cADPR) or nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) activates, whereas dialysis of AMP inhibits, TRPM2 whole-cell currents. Additionally, H(2)O(2), cADPR, and NAADP enhance ADPR sensitivity of TRPM2 currents in intact cells. Because in whole-cell recordings the entire cellular machinery for nucleotide and Ca(2+) homeostasis is intact, modulators might affect TRPM2 activity either directly, by binding to TRPM2, or indirectly, by altering the local concentrations of the primary ligands ADPR and Ca(2+). To identify direct modulators of TRPM2, we have studied the effects of H(2)O(2), AMP, cADPR, NAADP, and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide in inside-out patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing human TRPM2, by directly exposing the cytosolic faces of the patches to these compounds. H(2)O(2) (1 mM) and enzymatically purified cADPR (10 $\mu$M) failed to activate, whereas AMP (200 $\mu$M) failed to inhibit TRPM2 currents. NAADP was a partial agonist (maximal efficacy, ∼50{\%}), and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide was a full agonist, but both had very low affinities (K(0.5) = 104 and 35 $\mu$M). H(2)O(2), cADPR, and NAADP did not enhance activation by ADPR. Considering intracellular concentrations of these compounds, none of them are likely to directly affect the TRPM2 channel protein in a physiological context.},

abstract = {Hippocampal oscillations reflect coordinated neuronal activity on many timescales. Distinct types of GABAergic interneuron participate in the coordination of pyramidal cells over different oscillatory cycle phases. In the CA3 area, which generates sharp waves and gamma oscillations, the contribution of identified GABAergic neurons remains to be defined. We have examined the firing of a family of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons during network oscillations in urethane-anesthetized rats and compared them with firing of CA3 pyramidal cells. The position of the terminals of individual visualized interneurons was highly diverse, selective, and often spatially coaligned with either the entorhinal or the associational inputs to area CA3. The spike timing in relation to theta and gamma oscillations and sharp waves was correlated with the innervated pyramidal cell domain. Basket and dendritic-layer-innervating interneurons receive entorhinal and associational inputs and preferentially fire on the ascending theta phase, when pyramidal cell assemblies emerge. Perforant-path-associated cells, driven by recurrent collaterals of pyramidal cells fire on theta troughs, when established pyramidal cell assemblies are most active. In the CA3 area, slow and fast gamma oscillations occurred on opposite theta oscillation phases. Perforant-path-associated and some COUP-TFII-positive interneurons are strongly coupled to both fast and slow gamma oscillations, but basket and dendritic-layer-innervating cells are weakly coupled to fast gamma oscillations only. During sharp waves, different interneuron types are activated, inhibited, or remain unaffected. We suggest that specialization in pyramidal cell domain and glutamatergic input-specific operations, reflected in the position of GABAergic terminals, is the evolutionary drive underlying the diversity of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons.},

abstract = {Familiar concepts for small mols. may require reinterpretation for larger systems. For example, rearrangements between geometrical isomers are usually considered in terms of transitions between the corresponding local min. on the underlying potential energy surface, V. However, transitions between bulk phases such as solid and liq., or between the denatured and native states of a protein, are normally addressed in terms of free energy min. To reestablish a connection with the potential energy surface we must think in terms of representative samples of local min. of V, from which a free energy surface is projected by averaging over most of the coordinates. The present contribution outlines how this connection can be developed into a tool for quant. calcns. In particular, stepping between the local min. of V provides powerful methods for locating the global potential energy min., and for calcg. global thermodn. properties. When the transition states that link local min. are also sampled we can exploit statistical rate theory to obtain insight into global dynamics and rare events. Visualizing the potential energy landscape helps to explain how the network of local min. and transition states dets. properties such as heat capacity features, which signify transitions between free energy min. The organization of the landscape also reveals how certain systems can reliably locate particular structures on the exptl. time scale from among an exponentially large no. of local min.

abstract = {Neurotransmitter and hormon release is based on Ca2+ dependent exocytosis. The sequential steps of exocytosis are executed by proteins and protein complexes. Formation of the SNARE complex is essential in later steps of exocytosis. The Sec1/Munc18 proteins are also essential in exocytosis and other membrane trafficking processes but their molecular and cellular function is less clear than that of the SNARE proteins.In our work we studied the role of Munc18 in large dense-core vesicle exocytosis in adrenal chromaffin cells. We combined complementary techniques (electrophysiology, electronmicroscopy) to assay docking, priming and Ca2+ triggered fusion of the vesicles. First, we further confirmed the view that Munc18-1 is a positive regulator of large dense-core vesicle exocytosis. Second, we were interested the downstream molecular targets of Munc18-1 therefore we studied the physiological role of Munc18-1/syntaxin1 interaction. We showed that this interaction is highly important in functional vesicle docking but further experiments are needed to decide whether it is the only major factor or there are other essential downstream targets for Munc18-1. Third, we studied different Munc18 isoforms and our results imply that Munc18 may act not only at the docking but also at the priming step of large dense-core exocytosis. Although some publications argue for the regulatory role of Munc18 in single vesicle fusion kinetics, we found no sign for the direct involvement of Munc18 in Ca2+ triggered fusion. Fourth, we also focused on the upstream regulation of Munc18-1. We obtained opposing data to the hypothesis that Munc18-1 is an important element of the phorbol ester induced potentiation of catecholamine release in the diacylglycerol (DAG) route. The DAG pathway remains an important but poorly understood regulator of transmitter/hormon release, which probably has multiple branches targeting multiple molecules and exocytic steps. Taken together, our findings provided inspiring hints about many aspects of Munc18 function in Ca2+ dependent exocytosis. Perhaps the most important aspect is to match the consecutive steps of exocytosis with the molecular happenings along the Munc18/syntaxin complex SNARE complex axis. Our complementary assays combined with the gene knockout and rescue technique could promote adrenal chromaffin cells to become the first system where this match between cellular function and molecular structure is clarified.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression that regulate important oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Many miRNAs can also act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, and thus the altered expression of miRNAs is a hallmark of many cancer types. Dysregulated miRNAs provide a potentially powerful new tool that could be used to enable the characterization of tumor environments and identify novel and important oncogenic pathways. More recently, there has been growing interest in the field of miRNAs as biomarkers of cancer risk, diagnosis and response to therapy. Understanding the associations between miRNA expression and cancer phenotypes, and the potential of miRNA profiling in clinical applications, promises to be highly rewarding in the field of cancer research. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many neurosecretory preparations display two components of depolarization-induced exocytosis: a phasic component synchronized with Ca2+ channel opening, followed by a slower sustained component. We evaluated possible mechanisms underlying this biphasic behavior by stimulating mouse chromaffin cells in situ with both depolarizations and flash photolysis of caged Ca2+. From a direct comparison of the secretory responses to both stimuli, we conclude that phasic and sustained release components originate from a readily releasable pool (RRP) of equally fusion-competent vesicles, suggesting that differences in the vesicles' proximity to Ca2+ channels underlie the biphasic secretory behavior. An intermediate pool in dynamic equilibrium with the RRP ensures rapid recruitment of release-ready vesicles after RRP depletion. Our results are discussed in terms of a refined model for secretion in chromaffin cells.},

abstract = {The large number of cell divisions required to make a human body inevitably leads to the accumulation of somatic mutations. Such mutations cause individuals to be somatic mosaics. Recent advances in genomic technology now allow measurement of somatic diversity. Initial studies confirmed the expected high levels of somatic mutations within individuals. Going forward, the big questions concern the degree to which those somatic mutations influence disease. Theory predicts that the frequency of mutant cells should vary greatly between individuals. Such somatic mutational variability between individuals could explain much of the diversity in the risk of disease. But how variable is mosaicism between individuals in reality? What is the relation between the fraction of cells carrying a predisposing mutation and the risk of disease? What kinds of heritable somatic change lead to disease besides classical DNA mutations? What molecular processes connect a predisposing somatic change to disease? We know that predisposing somatic mutations strongly influence the onset of cancer. Likewise, neurodegenerative diseases may often begin from somatically mutated cells. If so, both neurodegeneration and cancer may be diseases of later life for which much of the risk may be set by early life somatic mutations.},

abstract = {A fundamental goal in cellular signaling is to understand allosteric communication, the process by which signals originating at one site in a protein propagate reliably to affect distant functional sites. The general principles of protein structure that underlie this process remain unknown. Here, we describe a sequence-based statistical method for quantitatively mapping the global network of amino acid interactions in a protein. Application of this method for three structurally and functionally distinct protein families (G protein-coupled receptors, the chymotrypsin class of serine proteases and hemoglobins) reveals a surprisingly simple architecture for amino acid interactions in each protein family: a small subset of residues forms physically connected networks that link distant functional sites in the tertiary structure. Although small in number, residues comprising the network show excellent correlation with the large body of mechanistic data available for each family. The data suggest that evolutionarily conserved sparse networks of amino acid interactions represent structural motifs for allosteric communication in proteins.},

abstract = {Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation, which allow variable rates of substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first, called the “discrete gamma model,” uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method, called “fixed-rates model,” classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest trees are often found to be zero. The computational requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368–376) model, which assumes a single rate for all the sites.},

This phenomenon, known as Haldane's rule, is currently thought to be coincidentally caused by different mechanisms in separate entities. The following questions have never been asked: Are heterogametic and homogametic inferiority (sterility or inviability) equivalent as isolating mechanisms? Could discrepancies between them, if existing, produce Haldane's rule? Here I consider sex-biased hybrid inferiority strictly as an isolating mechanism, and quantitatively evaluate its strength in impeding gene flow. The comparison reveals that the ability of sex-biased inferiority to impede gene flow varies according to the sex and chromosome involved. Heterogametic inferiority is a weaker barrier when unidirectional and a much stronger one when in compound reciprocal directions, compared with homogametic inferiority. Such differential strength may affect divergence in speciation and produce Haldane's rule.},

abstract = {Because of functional constraints, substitution rates vary among the positions of a protein but are usually assumed to be constant at a given site during evolution. The distribution of the rates across the sequence positions generally fits a Gamma distribution. Models of sequence evolution were accordingly designed and led to improved phylogenetic reconstruction. However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of a given position is not always constant throughout time. We called such within-site rate variations heterotachy (for "different speed" in Greek). Yet, heterotachy was found among homologous sequences of distantly related organisms, often with different functions. In such cases, the functional constraints are likely different, which would explain the different distribution of variable sites. To evaluate the importance of heterotachy, we focused on amino acid sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b, for which the function is likely the same in all vertebrates. Using 2,038 sequences, we demonstrate that 95{\%} of the variable positions are heterotachous, i.e., underwent dramatic variations of substitution rate among vertebrate lineages. Heterotachy even occurs at small evolutionary scale, and in these cases it is very unlikely to be related to functional changes. Since a large number of sequences are required to efficiently detect heterotachy, the extent of this phenomenon could not be estimated for all proteins yet. It could be as large as for cytochrome b, since this protein is not a peculiar case. The observations made here open several new avenues of research, such as the understanding of the evolution of functional constraints or the improvement of phylogenetic reconstruction methods.},

abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway. ?? 1970.},

Currently, CpG islands are defined based on their genomic sequences alone. Here, we develop evolutionary models to show that several distinct evolutionary processes generate and maintain CpG islands. One central evolutionary regime resulting in enriched CpG content is driven by low levels of DNA methylation and consequentially low rates of CpG deamination. Another major force forming CpG islands is biased gene conversion that stabilizes constitutively methylated CpG islands by balancing rapid deamination with CpG fixation. Importantly, evolutionary analysis and population genetics data suggest that selection for high CpG content is not a significant factor contributing to conservation of CpGs in differentially methylated regions. The heterogeneous, but not selective, origins of CpG islands have direct implications for the understanding of DNA methylation patterns in healthy and diseased cells.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identification of residues that account for protein function specificity is crucial, not only for understanding the nature of functional specificity, but also for protein engineering experiments aimed at switching the specificity of an enzyme, regulator or transporter. Available algorithms generally use multiple sequence alignments to identify residue positions conserved within subfamilies but divergent in between. However, many biological examples show a much subtler picture than simple intra-group conservation versus inter-group divergence. RESULTS: We present multi-RELIEF, a novel approach for identifying specificity residues that is based on RELIEF, a state-of-the-art Machine-Learning technique for feature weighting. It estimates the expected 'local' functional specificity of residues from an alignment divided in multiple classes. Optionally, 3D structure information is exploited by increasing the weight of residues that have high-weight neighbors. Using ROC curves over a large body of experimental reference data, we show that (a) multi-RELIEF identifies specificity residues for the seven test sets used, (b) incorporating structural information improves prediction for specificity of interaction with small molecules and (c) comparison of multi-RELIEF with four other state-of-the-art algorithms indicates its robustness and best overall performance.

We first apply the method to bacterial two-component systems and comprehensively reconstruct two-component signaling networks across all sequenced bacteria. Comparisons of our predictions with known interactions show that our method infers interaction partners genome-wide with high accuracy. To demonstrate the general applicability of our method we show that it also accurately predicts interaction partners in a recent dataset of polyketide synthases. Analysis of the predicted genome-wide two-component signaling networks shows that cognates (interacting kinase/regulator pairs, which lie adjacent on the genome) and orphans (which lie isolated) form two relatively independent components of the signaling network in each genome. In addition, while most genes are predicted to have only a small number of interaction partners, we find that 10{\%} of orphans form a separate class of 'hub' nodes that distribute and integrate signals to and from up to tens of different interaction partners.},

abstract = {Contemporary protein architectures can be regarded as molecular fossils, historical imprints that mark important milestones in the history of life. Whereas sequences change at a considerable pace, higher-order structures are constrained by the energetic landscape of protein folding, the exploration of sequence and structure space, and complex interactions mediated by the proteostasis and proteolytic machineries of the cell. The survey of architectures in the living world that was fuelled by recent structural genomic initiatives has been summarized in protein classification schemes, and the overall structure of fold space explored with novel bioinformatic approaches. However, metrics of general structural comparison have not yet unified architectural complexity using the 'shared and derived' tenet of evolutionary analysis. In contrast, a shift of focus from molecules to proteomes and a census of protein structure in fully sequenced genomes were able to uncover global evolutionary patterns in the structure of proteins. Timelines of discovery of architectures and functions unfolded episodes of specialization, reductive evolutionary tendencies of architectural repertoires in proteomes and the rise of modularity in the protein world. They revealed a biologically complex ancestral proteome and the early origin of the archaeal lineage. Studies also identified an origin of the protein world in enzymes of nucleotide metabolism harbouring the P-loop-containing triphosphate hydrolase fold and the explosive discovery of metabolic functions that recapitulated well-defined prebiotic shells and involved the recruitment of structures and functions. These observations have important implications for origins of modern biochemistry and diversification of life.},

abstract = {Spatially proximate amino acids in a protein tend to coevolve. A protein's three-dimensional (3D) structure hence leaves an echo of correlations in the evolutionary record. Reverse engineering 3D structures from such correlations is an open problem in structural biology, pursued with increasing vigor as more and more protein sequences continue to fill the data banks. Within this task lies a statistical inference problem, rooted in the following: correlation between two sites in a protein sequence can arise from firsthand interaction but can also be network-propagated via intermediate sites; observed correlation is not enough to guarantee proximity. To separate direct from indirect interactions is an instance of the general problem of inverse statistical mechanics, where the task is to learn model parameters (fields, couplings) from observables (magnetizations, correlations, samples) in large systems. In the context of protein sequences, the approach has been referred to as direct-coupling analysis. Here we show that the pseudolikelihood method, applied to 21-state Potts models describing the statistical properties of families of evolutionarily related proteins, significantly outperforms existing approaches to the direct-coupling analysis, the latter being based on standard mean-field techniques. This improved performance also relies on a modified score for the coupling strength. The results are verified using known crystal structures of specific sequence instances of various protein families. Code implementing the new method can be found at http://plmdca.csc.kth.se/.},

Coarse-grained representations of the peptide chain have therefore been developed and over the last decade have proved extremely valuable. These include topology-based Go models, which constitute a smooth and funnel-like approximation to the folding landscape. We review the many variations of the Go model that have been employed to yield insight into folding mechanisms. Their success has been interpreted as a consequence of the dominant role of the native topology in folding. The role of local contact density in determining protein dynamics is also discussed and is used to explain the ability of Go-like models to capture sequence effects in folding and elucidate conformational transitions.},

abstract = {The need to maintain the structural and functional integrity of an evolving protein severely restricts the repertoire of acceptable amino-acid substitutions. However, it is not known whether these restrictions impose a global limit on how far homologous protein sequences can diverge from each other. Here we explore the limits of protein evolution using sequence divergence data. We formulate a computational approach to study the rate of divergence of distant protein sequences and measure this rate for ancient proteins, those that were present in the last universal common ancestor. We show that ancient proteins are still diverging from each other, indicating an ongoing expansion of the protein sequence universe. The slow rate of this divergence is imposed by the sparseness of functional protein sequences in sequence space and the ruggedness of the protein fitness landscape: approximately 98 per cent of sites cannot accept an amino-acid substitution at any given moment but a vast majority of all sites may eventually be permitted to evolve when other, compensatory, changes occur. Thus, approximately 3.5 x 10(9) yr has not been enough to reach the limit of divergent evolution of proteins, and for most proteins the limit of sequence similarity imposed by common function may not exceed that of random sequences.},

abstract = {Thefalse discovery rate (FDR) is amultiple hypothesis testing quantity that describes the expected proportion of false positive results among all rejected null hypotheses. Benjamini and Hochberg introduced this quantity and proved that a particular step-up p-value method con- trols the FDR. Storey introduced a point estimate of the FDR for fixed significance regions.The former approach conservatively controls the FDR at a fixed predetermined level, and the latter provides a conservatively biased estimate of the FDR for a fixed predetermined significance region. In this work, we show in both finite sample and asymptotic settings that the goals of the two approaches are essentially equivalent. In particular, the FDR point estimates can be used to define valid FDR controlling procedures. In the asymptotic setting,we also showthat the point estimates can be used to estimate the FDR conservatively over all significance regions simul- taneously, which is equivalent to controlling the FDR at all levels simultaneously.The main tool that we use is to translate existing FDR methods into procedures involving empirical processes. This simplifies finite sample proofs, provides a framework for asymptotic results and proves that these procedures are valid even under certain forms of dependence.},

First, we develop and validate epigenetic models of aging that are independent of blood cell composition. Using these models, we find that both chronic and recent HIV infection lead to an average aging advancement of 4.9 years, increasing expected mortality risk by 19{\%}. In addition, sustained infection results in global deregulation of the methylome across {\textgreater}80,000 CpGs and specific hypomethylation of the region encoding the human leukocyte antigen locus (HLA). We find that decreased HLA methylation is predictive of lower CD4 / CD8 T cell ratio, linking molecular aging, epigenetic regulation, and disease progression.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set. AVAILABILITY: The Dynamic Tree Cut method is implemented in an R package available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/BranchCutting.},

To deal with the expansion of WES in medical genomics individual laboratories, new convivial and versatile software tools have to implement these filtering steps. Non-programmer biologists have to be autonomous combining themselves different filtering criteria and conduct a personal strategy depending on their assumptions and study design.},

abstract = {Genetic studies indicate high number of potential factors related to asthma. Based on earlier linkage analyses we selected the 11q13 and 14q22 asthma susceptibility regions, for which we designed a partial genome screening study using 145 SNPs in 1201 individuals (436 asthmatic children and 765 controls). The results were evaluated with traditional frequentist methods and we applied a new statistical method, called bayesian network based bayesian multilevel analysis of relevance (BN-BMLA). This method uses bayesian network representation to provide detailed characterization of the relevance of factors, such as joint significance, the type of dependency, and multi-target aspects. We estimated posteriors for these relations within the bayesian statistical framework, in order to estimate the posteriors whether a variable is directly relevant or its association is only mediated.With frequentist methods one SNP (rs3751464 in the FRMD6 gene) provided evidence for an association with asthma (OR = 1.43(1.2-1.8); p = 3×10(-4)). The possible role of the FRMD6 gene in asthma was also confirmed in an animal model and human asthmatics.In the BN-BMLA analysis altogether 5 SNPs in 4 genes were found relevant in connection with asthma phenotype: PRPF19 on chromosome 11, and FRMD6, PTGER2 and PTGDR on chromosome 14. In a subsequent step a partial dataset containing rhinitis and further clinical parameters was used, which allowed the analysis of relevance of SNPs for asthma and multiple targets. These analyses suggested that SNPs in the AHNAK and MS4A2 genes were indirectly associated with asthma. This paper indicates that BN-BMLA explores the relevant factors more comprehensively than traditional statistical methods and extends the scope of strong relevance based methods to include partial relevance, global characterization of relevance and multi-target relevance.},

abstract = {Many loci maintain parent-of-origin DNA methylation only briefly after fertilization during mammalian development: Whether this form of transient genomic imprinting can impact the early embryonic transcriptome or even have life-long consequences on genome regulation and possibly phenotypes is currently unknown. Here, we report a maternal germline differentially methylated region (DMR) at the mouse Gpr1/Zdbf2 (DBF-type zinc finger-containing protein 2) locus, which controls the paternal-specific expression of long isoforms of Zdbf2 (Liz) in the early embryo. This DMR loses parental specificity by gain of DNA methylation at implantation in the embryo but is maintained in extraembryonic tissues. As a consequence of this transient, tissue-specific maternal imprinting, Liz expression is restricted to the pluripotent embryo, extraembryonic tissues, and pluripotent male germ cells. We found that Liz potentially functions as both Zdbf2-coding RNA and cis-regulatory RNA. Importantly, Liz-mediated events allow a switch from maternal to paternal imprinted DNA methylation and from Liz to canonical Zdbf2 promoter use during embryonic differentiation, which are stably maintained through somatic life and conserved in humans. The Gpr1/Zdbf2 locus lacks classical imprinting histone modifications, but analysis of mutant embryonic stem cells reveals fine-tuned regulation of Zdbf2 dosage through DNA and H3K27 methylation interplay. Together, our work underlines the developmental and evolutionary need to ensure proper Liz/Zdbf2 dosage as a driving force for dynamic genomic imprinting at the Gpr1/Zdbf2 locus.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that filtering microRNA (miRNA) target predictions by conservation or by accessibility can reduce the false discovery rate. However, these two strategies are usually not exploited in a combined and flexible manner. Here, we introduce PACCMIT, a flexible method that filters miRNA binding sites by their conservation, accessibility, or both. The improvement in performance obtained with each of these three filters is demonstrated on the prediction of targets for both i) highly and ii) weakly conserved miRNAs, i.e., in two scenarios in which the miRNA-target interactions are subjected to different evolutionary pressures. We show that in the first scenario conservation is a better filter than accessibility (as both sensitivity and precision are higher among the top predictions) and that the combined filter improves performance of PACCMIT even further. In the second scenario, on the other hand, the accessibility filter performs better than both the conservation and combined filters, suggesting that the site conservation is not equally effective in rejecting false positive predictions for all miRNAs. Regarding the quality of the ranking criterion proposed by Robins and Press and used in PACCMIT, it is shown that top ranking interactions correspond to more downregulated proteins than do the lower ranking interactions. Comparison with several other target prediction algorithms shows that the ranking of predictions provided by PACCMIT is at least as good as the ranking generated by other conservation-based methods and considerably better than the energy-based ranking used in other accessibility-based methods.},

We discover extremely widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci.

abstract = {The class of beta regression models is commonly used by practitioners to model vari- ables that assume values in the standard unit interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coefficients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (poten- tially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is briefly outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises.},

However, no such ATP sandwich complex has been observed for an ABC from an ABC transporter. In this paper, we report the crystal structure of a stable dimer formed by the E171Q mutant of the MJ0796 ABC, which is hydrolytically inactive due to mutation of the catalytic base. The structure shows a symmetrical dimer in which two ATP molecules are each sandwiched between the Walker A motif in one subunit and the LSGGQ signature motif in the other subunit. These results establish the stereochemical basis of the power stroke of ABC transporter pumps.},

However, the origin, extent, and patterns of genomic mutation in neurons remain unknown. We established a nuclear transfer method to clonally amplify the genomes of neurons from adult mice for whole-genome sequencing. Comprehensive mutation detection and independent validation revealed that individual neurons harbor ∼100 unique mutations from all classes but lack recurrent rearrangements. Most neurons contain at least one gene-disrupting mutation and rare (0-2) mobile element insertions. The frequency and gene bias of neuronal mutations differ from other lineages, potentially due to novel mechanisms governing postmitotic mutation. Fertile mice were cloned from several neurons, establishing the compatibility of mutated adult neuronal genomes with reprogramming to pluripotency and development.},

abstract = {Speciation is fundamental to understanding the huge diversity of life on Earth. Although still controversial, empirical evidence suggests that the rate of speciation is larger for smaller populations. Here, we explore a biophysical model of speciation by developing a simple coarse-grained theory of transcription factor-DNA binding and how their co-evolution in two geographically isolated lineages leads to incompatibilities. To develop a tractable analytical theory, we derive a Smoluchowski equation for the dynamics of binding energy evolution that accounts for the fact that natural selection acts on phenotypes, but variation arises from mutations in sequences; the Smoluchowski equation includes selection due to both gradients in fitness and gradients in sequence entropy, which is the logarithm of the number of sequences that correspond to a particular binding energy. This simple consideration predicts that smaller populations develop incompatibilities more quickly in the weak mutation regime; this trend arises as sequence entropy poises smaller populations closer to incompatible regions of phenotype space. These results suggest a generic coarse-grained approach to evolutionary stochastic dynamics, allowing realistic modelling at the phenotypic level.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identification of expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), the genetic loci that contribute to heritable variation in gene expression, can be obstructed by factors that produce variation in expression profiles if these factors are unmeasured or hidden from direct analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We have developed a method for Hidden Expression Factor analysis (HEFT) that identifies individual and pleiotropic effects of eQTL in the presence of hidden factors. The HEFT model is a combined multivariate regression and factor analysis, where the complete likelihood of the model is used to derive a ridge estimator for simultaneous factor learning and detection of eQTL. HEFT requires no pre-estimation of hidden factor effects; it provides P-values and is extremely fast, requiring just a few hours to complete an eQTL analysis of thousands of expression variables when analyzing hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms on a standard 8 core 2.6 G desktop.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: By analyzing simulated data, we demonstrate that HEFT can correct for an unknown number of hidden factors and significantly outperforms all related hidden factor methods for eQTL analysis when there are eQTL with univariate and multivariate (pleiotropic) effects. To demonstrate a real-world application, we applied HEFT to identify eQTL affecting gene expression in the human lung for a study that included presumptive hidden factors. HEFT identified all of the cis-eQTL found by other hidden factor methods and 91 additional cis-eQTL. HEFT also identified a number of eQTLs with direct relevance to lung disease that could not be found without a hidden factor analysis, including cis-eQTL for GTF2H1 and MTRR, genes that have been independently associated with lung cancer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: Software is available at http://mezeylab.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/Software.aspx.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in gene regulation, but reliable bioinformatic or experimental identification of their targets remains difficult. To provide an unbiased view of human miRNA targets, we developed a technique for ligation and sequencing of miRNA-target RNA duplexes associated with human AGO1. Here, we report data sets of more than 18,000 high-confidence miRNA-mRNA interactions. The binding of most miRNAs includes the 5??? seed region, but around 60{\%} of seed interactions are noncanonical, containing bulged or mismatched nucleotides. Moreover, seed interactions are generally accompanied by specific, nonseed base pairing. 18{\%} of miRNA-mRNA interactions involve the miRNA 3??? end, with little evidence for 5??? contacts, and some of these were functionally validated. Analyses of miRNA:mRNA base pairing showed that miRNA species systematically differ in their target RNA interactions, and strongly overrepresented motifs were found in the interaction sites of several miRNAs. We speculate that these affect the response of RISC to miRNA-target binding. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Consequently, despite dramatic advances in computational methodologies and resources, CG models enjoy surging popularity and are becoming increasingly equal partners to atomically detailed models. This perspective surveys the rapidly developing landscape of CG models for biomolecular systems. In particular, this review seeks to provide a balanced, coherent, and unified presentation of several distinct approaches for developing CG models, including top-down, network-based, native-centric, knowledge-based, and bottom-up modeling strategies. The review summarizes their basic philosophies, theoretical foundations, typical applications, and recent developments. Additionally, the review identifies fundamental inter-relationships among the diverse approaches and discusses outstanding challenges in the field. When carefully applied and assessed, current CG models provide highly efficient means for investigating the biological consequences of basic physicochemical principles. Moreover, rigorous bottom-up approaches hold great promise for further improving the accuracy and scope of CG models for biomolecular systems.},

The prediction method (EVfold{\_}membrane) applies a maximum entropy approach to infer evolutionary covariation in pairs of sequence positions within a protein family and then generates all-atom models with the derived pairwise distance constraints. We benchmark the approach with blinded de novo computation of known transmembrane protein structures from 23 families, demonstrating unprecedented accuracy of the method for large transmembrane proteins. We show how the method can predict oligomerization, functional sites, and conformational changes in transmembrane proteins. With the rapid rise in large-scale sequencing, more accurate and more comprehensive information on evolutionary constraints can be decoded from genetic variation, greatly expanding the repertoire of transmembrane proteins amenable to modeling by this method.},

Alternatively, a large-scale approach in search of different organizational features of the growth stages promises to reveal its modular global structure with the goal of discovering previously unknown relations between cell types. Here, we sort and analyze a large set of scattered data to construct the network of human cell differentiation (NHCD) based on cell types (nodes) and differentiation steps (links) from the fertilized egg to a developed human. We discover a dynamical law of critical branching that reveals a self-similar regularity in the modular organization of the network, and allows us to observe the network at different scales. The emerging picture clearly identifies clusters of cell types following a hierarchical organization, ranging from sub-modules to super-modules of specialized tissues and organs on varying scales. This discovery will allow one to treat the development of a particular cell function in the context of the complex network of human development as a whole. Our results point to an integrated large-scale view of the network of cell types systematically revealing ties between previously unrelated domains in organ functions.},

abstract = {CFTR is the only member of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein superfamily known to function as an ion channel. Most other ABC proteins are ATP-driven transporters, in which a cycle of ATP binding and hydrolysis, at intracellular nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), powers uphill substrate translocation across the membrane. In CFTR, this same ATP-driven cycle opens and closes a transmembrane pore through which chloride ions flow rapidly down their electrochemical gradient. Detailed analysis of the pattern of gating of CFTR channels thus offers the opportunity to learn about mechanisms of function not only of CFTR channels but also of their ABC transporter ancestors. In addition, CFTR channel gating is subject to complex regulation by kinase-mediated phosphorylation at multiple consensus sites in a cytoplasmic regulatory domain that is unique to CFTR. Here we offer a practical guide to extract useful information about the mechanisms that control opening and closing of CFTR channels: on how to plan (including information obtained from analysis of multiple sequence alignments), carry out, and analyze electrophysiological and biochemical experiments, as well as on how to circumvent potential pitfalls.},

abstract = {Energy landscape theories have provided a common ground for understanding the protein folding problem, which once seemed to be overwhelmingly complicated. At the same time, the native state was found to be an ensemble of interconverting states with frustration playing a more important role compared to the folding problem. The landscape of the folded protein - the native landscape - is glassier than the folding landscape; hence, a general description analogous to the folding theories is difficult to achieve. On the other hand, the native basin phase volume is much smaller, allowing a protein to fully sample its native energy landscape on the biological timescales. Current computational resources may also be used to perform this sampling for smaller proteins, to build a 'topographical map' of the native landscape that can be used for subsequent analysis. Several major approaches to representing this topographical map are highlighted in this review, including the construction of kinetic networks, hierarchical trees and free energy surfaces with subsequent structural and kinetic analyses. In this review, we extensively discuss the important question of choosing proper collective coordinates characterizing functional motions. In many cases, the substates on the native energy landscape, which represent different functional states, can be used to obtain variables that are well suited for building free energy surfaces and analyzing the protein's functional dynamics. Normal mode analysis can provide such variables in cases where functional motions are dictated by the molecule's architecture. Principal component analysis is a more expensive way of inferring the essential variables from the protein's motions, one that requires a long molecular dynamics simulation. Finally, the two popular models for the allosteric switching mechanism, 'preexisting equilibrium' and 'induced fit', are interpreted within the energy landscape paradigm as extreme points of a continuum of transition mechanisms. Some experimental evidence illustrating each of these two models, as well as intermediate mechanisms, is presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a complex disease. Genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors are known to contribute to COPD risk and disease progression. Therefore we developed a systematic approach to identify key regulators of COPD that integrates genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression, and phenotype data in lung tissue from COPD and control samples. Our integrative analysis identified 126 key regulators of COPD. We identified EPAS1 as the only key regulator whose downstream genes significantly overlapped with multiple genes sets associated with COPD disease severity. EPAS1 is distinct in comparison with other key regulators in terms of methylation profile and downstream target genes. Genes predicted to be regulated by EPAS1 were enriched for biological processes including signaling, cell communications, and system development. We confirmed that EPAS1 protein levels are lower in human COPD lung tissue compared to non-disease controls and that Epas1 gene expression is reduced in mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke. As EPAS1 downstream genes were significantly enriched for hypoxia responsive genes in endothelial cells, we tested EPAS1 function in human endothelial cells. EPAS1 knockdown by siRNA in endothelial cells impacted genes that significantly overlapped with EPAS1 downstream genes in lung tissue including hypoxia responsive genes, and genes associated with emphysema severity. Our first integrative analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles illustrates that not only does DNA methylation play a 'causal' role in the molecular pathophysiology of COPD, but it can be leveraged to directly identify novel key mediators of this pathophysiology.},

abstract = {We review the applicability of Bayesian networks (BNs) for discovering relations between genes, environment, and disease. By translating probabilistic dependencies among variables into graphical models and vice versa, BNs provide a comprehensible and modular framework for representing complex systems. We first describe the Bayesian network approach and its applicability to understanding the genetic and environmental basis of disease. We then describe a variety of algorithms for learning the structure of a network from observational data. Because of their relevance to real-world applications, the topics of missing data and causal interpretation are emphasized. The BN approach is then exemplified through application to data from a population-based study of bladder cancer in New Hampshire, USA. For didactical purposes, we intentionally keep this example simple. When applied to complete data records, we find only minor differences in the performance and results of different algorithms. Subsequent incorporation of partial records through application of the EM algorithm gives us greater power to detect relations. Allowing for network structures that depart from a strict causal interpretation also enhances our ability to discover complex associations including gene-gene (epistasis) and gene-environment interactions. While BNs are already powerful tools for the genetic dissection of disease and generation of prognostic models, there remain some conceptual and computational challenges. These include the proper handling of continuous variables and unmeasured factors, the explicit incorporation of prior knowledge, and the evaluation and communication of the robustness of substantive conclusions to alternative assumptions and data manifestations.},

abstract = {A major task of evolutionary biology is the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from molecular data. The evolutionary model is given by a Markov chain on a tree. Given samples from the leaves of the Markov chain, the goal is to reconstruct the leaf-labelled tree.   It is well known that in order to reconstruct a tree on {\$}n{\$} leaves, sample sequences of length {\$}\backslashOmega(\backslashlog n){\$} are needed. It was conjectured by M. Steel that for the CFN/Ising evolutionary model, if the mutation probability on all edges of the tree is less than {\$}p{\^{}}{\{}\backslashast{\}} = (\backslashsqrt{\{}2{\}}-1)/2{\^{}}{\{}3/2{\}}{\$}, then the tree can be recovered from sequences of length {\$}O(\backslashlog n){\$}. The value {\$}p{\^{}}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$} is given by the transition point for the extremality of the free Gibbs measure for the Ising model on the binary tree. Steel's conjecture was proven by the second author in the special case where the tree is "balanced." The second author also proved that if all edges have mutation probability larger than {\$}p{\^{}}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$} then the length needed is {\$}n{\^{}}{\{}\backslashOmega(1){\}}{\$}. Here we show that Steel's conjecture holds true for general trees by giving a reconstruction algorithm that recovers the tree from {\$}O(\backslashlog n){\$}-length sequences when the mutation probabilities are discretized and less than {\$}p{\^{}}\backslashast{\$}. Our proof and results demonstrate that extremality of the free Gibbs measure on the infinite binary tree, which has been studied before in probability, statistical physics and computer science, determines how distinguishable are Gibbs measures on finite binary trees.},

abstract = {Protein stability and folding are the result of cooperative interactions among many residues, yet phylogenetic approaches assume that sites are independent. This discrepancy has engendered concerns about large evolutionary shifts in mutational effects that might confound phylogenetic approaches. Here we experimentally investigate this issue by introducing the same mutations into a set of diverged homologs of the influenza nucleoprotein and measuring the effects on stability. We find that mutational effects on stability are largely conserved across the homologs. We reach qualitatively similar conclusions when we simulate protein evolution with molecular-mechanics force fields. Our results do not mean that proteins evolve without epistasis, which can still arise even when mutational stability effects are conserved. However, our findings indicate that large evolutionary shifts in mutational effects on stability are rare, at least among homologs with similar structures and functions. We suggest that properly describing the clearly observable and highly conserved amino acid preferences at individual sites is likely to be far more important for phylogenetic analyses than accounting for rare shifts in amino acid propensities due to site covariation.},

abstract = {Direct or indirect inter-residue interactions in proteins are often reflected by mutations at one site that compensate for mutations at another site. Various bioinformatic methods have been developed for detecting such correlated mutations in order to obtain information about intra- and inter-protein interactions. Here, we show by carrying out a correlated mutation analysis for non-interacting proteins that the signal due to inter-residue interactions is of similar magnitude to the 'noise' that arises from other evolutionary processes related to common ancestry. A new method for detecting correlated mutations is presented that reduces this evolutionary noise by taking into account evolutionary distances in the protein family. It is shown that this method yields better signal-to-noise ratios and, therefore, can much better resolve, for example, correlated mutations that reflect true inter-residue interactions.},

abstract = {The substitution rate in a gene can provide valuable information for understanding its functionality and evolution. A widely used method to estimate substitution rates is the maximum-likelihood method implemented in the CODEML program in the PAML package. A limited number of branch models, chosen based on a priori information or an interest in a particular lineage(s), are tested, whereas a large number of potential models are neglected. A complementary approach is also needed to test all or a large number of possible models to search for the globally optional model(s) of maximum likelihood. However, the computational time for this search even in a small number of sequences becomes impractically long. Thus, it is desirable to explore the most probable spaces to search for the optimal models. Using dynamic programming techniques, we developed a simple computational method for searching the most probable optimal branch-specific models in a practically feasible computational time. We propose three search methods to find the optimal models, which explored O(n) (method 1) to O(n(2)) (method 2 and method 3) models when the given phylogeny has n branches. In addition, we derived a formula to calculate the number of all possible models, revealing the complexity of finding the optimal branch-specific model. We show that in a reanalysis of over 50 previously published studies, the vast majority obtained better models with significantly higher likelihoods than the conventional hypothesis model methods.},

Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations. Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of NGS tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers.},

A subset, known as driver mutations, confer clonal selective advantage on cancer cells and are causally implicated in oncogenesis, and the remainder are passenger mutations. The driver mutations and mutational processes operative in breast cancer have not yet been comprehensively explored. Here we examine the genomes of 100 tumours for somatic copy number changes and mutations in the coding exons of protein-coding genes. The number of somatic mutations varied markedly between individual tumours. We found strong correlations between mutation number, age at which cancer was diagnosed and cancer histological grade, and observed multiple mutational signatures, including one present in about ten per cent of tumours characterized by numerous mutations of cytosine at TpC dinucleotides. Driver mutations were identified in several new cancer genes including AKT2, ARID1B, CASP8, CDKN1B, MAP3K1, MAP3K13, NCOR1, SMARCD1 and TBX3. Among the 100 tumours, we found driver mutations in at least 40 cancer genes and 73 different combinations of mutated cancer genes.

abstract = {CFTR, the product of the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis, is an ATPase that functions as a Cl(-) channel in which bursts of openings separate relatively long interburst closed times (tauib). Channel gating is controlled by phosphorylation and MgATP, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain controversial. To investigate them, we expressed CFTR channels in Xenopus oocytes and examined, in excised patches, how gating kinetics of phosphorylated channels were affected by changes in [MgATP], by alterations in the chemical structure of the activating nucleotide, and by mutations expected to impair nucleotide hydrolysis and/or diminish nucleotide binding affinity. The rate of opening to a burst (1/tauib) was a saturable function of [MgATP], but apparent affinity was reduced by mutations in either of CFTR's nucleotide binding domains (NBDs): K464A in NBD1, and K1250A or D1370N in NBD2. Burst duration of neither wild-type nor mutant channels was much influenced by [MgATP]. Poorly hydrolyzable nucleotide analogs, MgAMPPNP, MgAMPPCP, and MgATPgammaS, could open CFTR channels, but only to a maximal rate of opening approximately 20-fold lower than attained by MgATP acting on the same channels. NBD2 catalytic site mutations K1250A, D1370N, and E1371S were found to prolong open bursts. Corresponding NBD1 mutations did not affect timing of burst termination in normal, hydrolytic conditions. However, when hydrolysis at NBD2 was impaired, the NBD1 mutation K464A shortened the prolonged open bursts. In light of recent biochemical and structural data, the results suggest that: nucleotide binding to both NBDs precedes channel opening; at saturating nucleotide concentrations the rate of opening to a burst is influenced by the structure of the phosphate chain of the activating nucleotide; normal, rapid exit from bursts occurs after hydrolysis of the nucleotide at NBD2, without requiring a further nucleotide binding step; if hydrolysis at NBD2 is prevented, exit from bursts occurs through a slower pathway, the rate of which is modulated by the structure of the NBD1 catalytic site and its bound nucleotide. Based on these and other results, we propose a mechanism linking hydrolytic and gating cycles via ATP-driven dimerization of CFTR's NBDs.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The identification of protein sites undergoing correlated evolution (coevolution) is of great interest due to the possibility that these pairs will tend to be adjacent in the three-dimensional structure. Identification of such pairs should provide useful information for understanding the evolutionary process, predicting the effects of site-directed substitution, and potentially for predicting protein structure. Here, we develop and apply a maximum likelihood method with the aim of improving detection of coevolution. Unlike previous methods which have had limited success, this method allows for correlations induced by phylogenetic relationships and for variation in rate of evolution along branches, and does not rely on accurate reconstruction of ancestral nodes. In order to reduce the complexity of coevolutionary relationships and identify the primary component of pairwise coevolution between two sites, we reduce the data to a two-state system at each site, regardless of the actual number of residues observed at that site. Simulations show that this strategy is good at identifying simple correlations and at recognizing cases in which the data are insufficient to distinguish between coevolution and spurious correlations. The new method was tested by using size and charge characteristics to group the residues at each site, and then evaluating coevolution in myoglobin sequences. Grouping based on physicochemical characteristics allows categorization of coevolving sites into positive and negative coevolution, depending on the correlation between equilibrium state frequencies. We detected a striking excess of negative coevolution (corresponding to charge) at sites brought into proximity by the periodicity of the alpha-helix, and there was also a tendency for sites with significant likelihood ratios to be close in the three-dimensional structure. Sites on the surface of the protein appear to coevolve both when they are close in the structure, and when they are distant, implying a role for folding and/or avoidance of quaternary structure in the coevolution process.},

abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic, and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown, unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models. We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. We introduce "surrogate variable analysis" (SVA) to overcome the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies.},

abstract = {Summary$\backslash$n          There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {Unique among ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein family members, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), also termed ABCC7, encoded by the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis patients, functions as an ion channel. Opening and closing of its anion-selective pore are linked to ATP binding and hydrolysis at CFTR's two NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains), NBD1 and NBD2. Isolated NBDs of prokaryotic ABC proteins form homodimers upon binding ATP, but separate after hydrolysis of the ATP. By combining mutagenesis with single-channel recording and nucleotide photolabelling on intact CFTR molecules, we relate opening and closing of the channel gates to ATP-mediated events in the NBDs. In particular, we demonstrate that two CFTR residues, predicted to lie on opposite sides of its anticipated NBD1-NBD2 heterodimer interface, are energetically coupled when the channels open but are independent of each other in closed channels. This directly links ATP-driven tight dimerization of CFTR's cytoplasmic NBDs to opening of the ion channel in the transmembrane domains. Evolutionary conservation of the energetically coupled residues in a manner that preserves their ability to form a hydrogen bond argues that this molecular mechanism, involving dynamic restructuring of the NBD dimer interface, is shared by all members of the ABC protein superfamily.},

abstract = {Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of regulation in biology. The residues at the end points of long-range allosteric perturbations are commonly identified by the comparative analyses of structures and dynamics in apo and effector-bound states. However, the networks of interactions mediating the propagation of allosteric signals between the end points often remain elusive. Here we show that the covariance analysis of NMR chemical shift changes caused by a set of covalently modified analogs of the allosteric effector (i.e., agonists and antagonists) reveals extended networks of coupled residues. Unexpectedly, such networks reach not only sites subject to effector-dependent structural variations, but also regions that are controlled by dynamically driven allostery. In these regions the allosteric signal is propagated mainly by dynamic rather than structural modulations, which result in subtle but highly correlated chemical shift variations. The proposed chemical shift covariance analysis (CHESCA) identifies interresidue correlations based on the combination of agglomerative clustering (AC) and singular value decomposition (SVD). AC results in dendrograms that define functional clusters of coupled residues, while SVD generates score plots that provide a residue-specific dissection of the contributions to binding and allostery. The CHESCA approach was validated by applying it to the cAMP-binding domain of the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) and the CHESCA results are in full agreement with independent mutational data on EPAC activation. Overall, CHESCA is a generally applicable method that utilizes a selected chemical library of effector analogs to quantitatively decode the binding and allosteric information content embedded in chemical shift changes.},

The importance of having the rate at which a point mutation occurs depend on the DNA sequence at sites surrounding the mutation is now better appreciated and can be accommodated in probabilistic models of protein evolution. To quantify the evolutionary impact of some aspect of phenotype, one promising strategy is to develop a system for predicting phenotype from the DNA sequence and to then infer how the evolutionary rates of sequence change are affected by the predicted phenotypic consequences of the changes. Although statistical tools for characterizing protein evolution are improving, the list of candidate phenomena that can affect rates of protein evolution is long and the relative contributions of these phenomena are only beginning to be disentangled.},

abstract = {We use an integrated approach to understand breast cancer heterogeneity by modeling mRNA, copy number alterations, microRNAs, and methylation in a pathway context utilizing the pathway recognition algorithm using data integration on genomic models (PARADIGM). We demonstrate that combining mRNA expression and DNA copy number classified the patients in groups that provide the best predictive value with respect to prognosis and identified key molecular and stromal signatures. A chronic inflammatory signature, which promotes the development and/or progression of various epithelial tumors, is uniformly present in all breast cancers. We further demonstrate that within the adaptive immune lineage, the strongest predictor of good outcome is the acquisition of a gene signature that favors a high T-helper 1 (Th1)/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response at the expense of Th2-driven humoral immunity. Patients who have breast cancer with a basal HER2-negative molecular profile (PDGM2) are characterized by high expression of protumorigenic Th2/humoral-related genes (24-38{\%}) and a low Th1/Th2 ratio. The luminal molecular subtypes are again differentiated by low or high FOXM1 and ERBB4 signaling. We show that the interleukin signaling profiles observed in invasive cancers are absent or weakly expressed in healthy tissue but already prominent in ductal carcinoma in situ, together with ECM and cell-cell adhesion regulating pathways. The most prominent difference between low and high mammographic density in healthy breast tissue by PARADIGM was that of STAT4 signaling. In conclusion, by means of a pathway-based modeling methodology (PARADIGM) integrating different layers of molecular data from whole-tumor samples, we demonstrate that we can stratify immune signatures that predict patient survival.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) contains multiple membrane spanning sequences that form a Cl- channel pore and cytosolic domains that control the opening and closing of the channel. The fourth intracellular loop (ICL4), which connects the tenth and eleventh transmembrane spans, has a primary sequence that is highly conserved across species, is the site of a preserved sequence motif in the ABC transporter family, and contains a relatively large number of missense mutations associated with cystic fibrosis (CF). To investigate the role of ICL4 in CFTR function and to learn how CF mutations in this region disrupt function, we studied several CF-associated ICL4 mutants. We found that most ICL4 mutants disrupted the biosynthetic processing of CFTR, although not as severely as the most common DeltaF508 mutation. The mutations had no discernible effect on the channel's pore properties; but some altered gating behavior, the response to increasing concentrations of ATP, and stimulation in response to pyrophosphate. These effects on activity were similar to those observed with mutations in the nucleotide-binding domains, suggesting that ICL4 might help couple activity of the nucleotide-binding domains to gating of the Cl- channel pore. The data also explain how these mutations cause a loss of CFTR function and suggest that some patients with mutations in ICL4 may have a milder clinical phenotype because they retain partial activity of CFTR at the cell membrane.},

  abstract      = {Background Genetic mutations that cause human disease are conventionally considered to be inherited from one's parents and present in all somatic (body) cells. We do know, however, that most mutations that cause cancer arise somatically, and we are becoming increasingly aware of mutations that cause other diseases and that arise de novo, meaning they are undetectable in the parents. Some such de novo mutations arise in the gamete of a parent, but some arise after fertilization during embryonic development, generating somatic mutations. Somatic mutations occur in several neurodevelopmental diseases associated with epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, and intellectual disability, although their broader relevance for neurological disease is unknown. Cortical development—origins of pyramidal neurons and astrocytes in the cerebral cortex. (A) A neuroepithelial cell (red) at the ventricular zone serves as progenitor for both a pyramidal neuron (green-blue) as well as a radial glial cell (gold). (B) A newly differentiated neuron (blue) migrates along a radial glial process. (C) Neurons (blue) continue to migrate as intermediate progenitor cells (small yellow) form. (D) Intermediate progenitor cells begin to generate neurons (blue). (E) The progenitor cells in the ventricular zone begin to give rise to astrocytes (dark green). Interneurons (purple) generated elsewhere migrate tangentially. CP, cortical plate; IZ, intermediate zone; VZ, ventricular zone. The VZ early in development has a thickness of {\~{}}10 cell bodies (50 to 100 $\mu$m). The CP ranges in thickness from two to three cell bodies at the earliest stages of development, eventually forming a mature cerebral cortex that is 2 to 4 mm thick. Advances A key recent advance has been the increasing identification of somatic mutations in affected tissues. For example, somatic mutations in several genes (PIK3CA, AKT3, and mTOR) cause enlargement of just one hemisphere of the brain, a malformation called hemimegalencephaly that is highly associated with epilepsy. These mutations may or may not be found in the blood, the convenient source tissue for DNA analysis, thus presenting a challenge to disease gene identification. Remarkably, patients can show dysfunction of essentially an entire half of their cerebral cortex when only 8 to 35{\%} of the brain cells carry the mutation, suggesting that a minority of cells with a somatic mutation can disrupt the function of widespread cortical circuits. These discoveries suggest that somatic, perhaps brain-only, mosaic mutations may be important for other neurodevelopmental diseases. However, finding the mutations and the affected cells may require special study designs and technology. In parallel with the discovery of somatic mutations responsible for neurological disease has been a continuing interest in the possibility that somatic mutations may occur in brain cells during normal development. New technologies, such as the study of the genomes of single neurons, promise to address some of these questions by allowing the systematic analysis of all types of somatic mutations in normal and diseased tissue. Outlook The role of somatic mutation in neurological disease is only beginning to be explored and may have relevance to many types of conditions from brain malformations to epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism. Novel, highly sensitive technologies will allow more accurate evaluation of somatic mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders and during normal brain development. With the increased power now available in sequencing and genomic technologies has come the realization that within an organism, individual cellular genomes can diverge from one another. Poduri et al. (p. 10.1126/science.1237758) review how de novo mutations, which arise in the parental germ line, or during development of the child, are the cause of a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. Genetic mutations causing human disease are conventionally thought to be inherited through the germ line from one's parents and present in all somatic (body) cells, except for most cancer mutations, which arise somatically. Increasingly, somatic mutations are being identified in diseases other than cancer, including neurodevelopmental diseases. Somatic mutations can arise during the course of prenatal brain development and cause neurological disease—even when present at low levels of mosaicism, for example—resulting in brain malformations associated with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Novel, highly sensitive technologies will allow more accurate evaluation of somatic mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders and during normal brain development.},

We present VarScan, an open source tool for variant detection that is compatible with several short read aligners.

We have determined crystal structures for mouse NBD1 in unliganded, ADP- and ATP-bound states, with and without phosphorylation. This NBD1 differs from typical ABC domains in having added regulatory segments, a foreshortened subdomain interconnection, and an unusual nucleotide conformation. Moreover, isolated NBD1 has undetectable ATPase activity and its structure is essentially the same independent of ligand state. Phe508, which is commonly deleted in CF, is exposed at a putative NBD1-transmembrane interface. Our results are consistent with a CFTR mechanism, whereby channel gating occurs through ATP binding in an NBD1-NBD2 nucleotide sandwich that forms upon displacement of NBD1 regulatory segments.},

Recently, it was shown that Munc13-1 is essential for a post-docking step of synaptic vesicle fusion. To investigate the role of Munc13-1 in LDCV exocytosis, we overexpressed Munc13-1 in chromaffin cells and stimulated secretion by flash photolysis of caged calcium. Both components of the exocytotic burst, which represent the fusion of release-competent vesicles, were increased by a factor of three. The sustained component, which represents vesicle maturation and subsequent fusion, was increased by the same factor. The response to a second flash, however, was greatly reduced, indicating a depletion of release-competent vesicles. Since there was no apparent change in the number of docked vesicles, we conclude that Munc13-1 acts as a priming factor by accelerating the rate constant of vesicle transfer from a pool of docked, but unprimed vesicles to a pool of release-competent, primed vesicles.},

Here, using TCGA ovarian data, we surveyed the miRNAs, in the context of their predicted gene targets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Integration of miRNA and gene patterns yielded evidence that proximal pairs of miRNAs are processed from polycistronic primary transcripts, and that intronic miRNAs and their host gene mRNAs derive from common transcripts. Patterns of miRNA expression revealed multiple tumor subtypes and a set of 34 miRNAs predictive of overall patient survival. In a global analysis, miRNA:mRNA pairs anti-correlated in expression across tumors showed a higher frequency of in silico predicted target sites in the mRNA 3'-untranslated region (with less frequency observed for coding sequence and 5'-untranslated regions). The miR-29 family and predicted target genes were among the most strongly anti-correlated miRNA:mRNA pairs; over-expression of miR-29a in vitro repressed several anti-correlated genes (including DNMT3A and DNMT3B) and substantially decreased ovarian cancer cell viability.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study establishes miRNAs as having a widespread impact on gene expression programs in ovarian cancer, further strengthening our understanding of miRNA biology as it applies to human cancer. As with gene transcripts, miRNAs exhibit high diversity reflecting the genomic heterogeneity within a clinically homogeneous disease population. Putative miRNA:mRNA interactions, as identified using integrative analysis, can be validated. TCGA data are a valuable resource for the identification of novel tumor suppressive miRNAs in ovarian as well as other cancers.},

abstract = {The ABC (ATP Binding Cassette) transporter protein superfamily comprises a large number of ubiquitous and functionally versatile proteins conserved from archaea to humans. ABC transporters have a key role in many human diseases and also in the development of multidrug resistance in cancer and in parasites. Although a dramatic progress has been achieved in ABC protein studies in the last decades, we are still far from a detailed understanding of their molecular functions. Several aspects of pharmacological ABC transporter targeting also remain unclear. Here we summarize the conformational and protonation changes of ABC transporters and the potential use of this information in pharmacological design. Network related methods, which recently became useful tools to describe protein structure and dynamics, have not been applied to study allosteric coupling in ABC proteins as yet. A detailed description of the strengths and limitations of these methods is given, and their potential use in describing ABC transporter dynamics is outlined. Finally, we highlight possible future aspects of pharmacological utilization of network methods and outline the future trends of this exciting field.},

abstract = {Current microRNA target predictions are based on sequence information and empirically derived rules but do not make use of the expression of microRNAs and their targets. This study aimed to improve microRNA target predictions in a given biological context, using in silico predictions, microRNA and mRNA expression. We used target prediction tools to produce lists of predicted targets and used a gene set test designed to detect consistent effects of microRNAs on the joint expression of multiple targets. In a single test, association between microRNA expression and target gene set expression as well as the contribution of the individual target genes on the association are determined. The strongest negatively associated mRNAs as measured by the test were prioritized. We applied our integration method to a well-defined muscle differentiation model. Validation of our predictions in C2C12 cells confirmed predicted targets of known as well as novel muscle-related microRNAs. We further studied associations between microRNA-mRNA pairs in human prostate cancer, finding some pairs that have been recently experimentally validated by others. Using the same study, we showed the advantages of the global test over Pearson correlation and lasso. We conclude that our integrated approach successfully identifies regulated microRNAs and their targets.},

abstract = {Errors in sample annotation or labeling often occur in large-scale genetic or genomic studies and are difficult to avoid completely during data generation and management. For integrative genomic studies, it is critical to identify and correct these errors. Different types of genetic and genomic data are inter-connected by cis-regulations. On that basis, we developed a computational approach, Multi-Omics Data Matcher (MODMatcher), to identify and correct sample labeling errors in multiple types of molecular data, which can be used in further integrative analysis. Our results indicate that inspection of sample annotation and labeling error is an indispensable data quality assurance step. Applied to a large lung genomic study, MODMatcher increased statistically significant genetic associations and genomic correlations by more than two-fold. In a simulation study, MODMatcher provided more robust results by using three types of omics data than two types of omics data. We further demonstrate that MODMatcher can be broadly applied to large genomic data sets containing multiple types of omics data, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets.},

@article{Simons1999,
abstract = {To generate structures consistent with both the localandnonlocal interactions respon- sible for protein stability, 3 and 9 residue fragments of known structures with local sequences similar to the target sequence were assembled into complete tertiary structures using a Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedure (Simons et al., JMol Biol 1997; 268:209–225). The scoring function used in the simu- lated annealing procedure consists of sequence- dependent terms representing hydrophobic burial and specific pair interactions such as electrostatics and disulfide bonding and sequence-independent terms representing hard sphere packing, ?-helix and?-strand packing,andthe collection of?-strands in ?-sheets (Simons et al., Proteins 1999;34:82–95). For each of 21 small, ab initio targets, 1,200 final structures were constructed, each the result of 100,000 attempted fragment substitutions. The five structures submitted for the CASP III experiment were chosen from the approximately 25 structures with the lowest scores in the broadest minima (as- sessed through the number of structural neighbors; Shortle et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1998;95:1158– 1162). The results were encouraging: highlights of the predictions include a 99-residue segment for MarAwith an rmsd of 6.4 {\AA} to the native structure, a 95-residue (full length) prediction for the EH2 do- main of EPS15 with an rmsd of 6.0 {\AA}, a 75-residue segment ofDNABhelicase with an rmsd of 4.7 {\AA}, and a 67-residue segment of ribosomal protein L30 with an rmsd of 3.8 {\AA}. These results suggest that ab initio methods may soon become useful for low-resolution structure prediction for proteins that lack a close homologue of known structure.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Compensating alterations during the evolution of protein families give rise to coevolving positions that contain important structural and functional information. However, a high background composed of random noise and phylogenetic components interferes with the identification of coevolving positions. RESULTS: We have developed a rapid, simple and general method based on information theory that accurately estimates the level of background mutual information for each pair of positions in a given protein family. Removal of this background results in a metric, MIp, that correctly identifies substantially more coevolving positions in protein families than any existing method. A significant fraction of these positions coevolve strongly with one or only a few positions. The vast majority of such position pairs are in contact in representative structures. The identification of strongly coevolving position pairs can be used to impose significant structural limitations and should be an important additional constraint for ab initio protein folding.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic H5N1 is a major avian pathogen that intensively affects the poultry industry in Egypt even in spite of the adoption of vaccination strategy. Antigenic drift is among the strategies the influenza virus uses to escape the immune system that might develop due to the pressure of extensive vaccination. H5N1 mutates in an intensified manner and is considered a potential candidate for the possible next pandemic with all the catastrophic consequences such an eventuality will entail. METHODS: H5N1 was isolated from the pooled organ samples of four different affected flocks in specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs (SPF-ECE). A reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to the haemagglutingin and neuraminidase. Sequencing of the full length haemagglutingin was performed. Sequence analyses of the isolated strains were performed and compared to all available H5N1 from Egyptian human and avian strains in the flu data base. Changes in the different amino acid that may be related to virus virulence, receptor affinity and epitope configuration were assigned and matched with all available Egyptian strains in the flu database. RESULTS: One out of the four strains was found to be related to the B2 Egyptian lineage, 2 were related to A1 lineage and the 4th was related to A2 lineage. Comparing data obtained from the current study by other available Egyptian H5N1 sequences remarkably demonstrate that amino acid changes in the immune escape variants are remarkably restricted to a limited number of locations on the HA molecule during antigenic drift. Molecular diversity in the HA gene, in relevance to different epitopes, were not found to follow a regular trend, suggesting abrupt cumulative sequence mutations. However a number of amino acids were found to be subjected to high mutation pressure. CONCLUSION: The current data provides a comprehensive view of HA gene evolution among H5N1 subtype viruses in Egypt. Egyptian H5N1-AIVs are constantly undergoing genetic changes and reveal a complex pattern of drifts. These findings raise the concerns about the value of using influenza vaccines in correlation with the development of antigenic drift in influenza epidemics.},

abstract = {Protein sequence alignments have become an important tool for molecular biologists. Local alignments are frequently constructed with the aid of a "substitution score matrix" that specifies a score for aligning each pair of amino acid residues. Over the years, many different substitution matrices have been proposed, based on a wide variety of rationales. Statistical results, however, demonstrate that any such matrix is implicitly a "log-odds" matrix, with a specific target distribution for aligned pairs of amino acid residues. In the light of information theory, it is possible to express the scores of a substitution matrix in bits and to see that different matrices are better adapted to different purposes. The most widely used matrix for protein sequence comparison has been the PAM-250 matrix. It is argued that for database searches the PAM-120 matrix generally is more appropriate, while for comparing two specific proteins with suspected homology the PAM-200 matrix is indicated. Examples discussed include the lipocalins, human alpha 1 B-glycoprotein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and the globins.},

abstract = {Modeling the interplay between mutation and selection at the molecular level is key to evolutionary studies. To this end, codon-based evolutionary models have been proposed as pertinent means of studying long-range evolutionary patterns and are widely used. However, these approaches have not yet consolidated results from amino acid level phylogenetic studies showing that selection acting on proteins displays strong site-specific effects, which translate into heterogeneous amino acid propensities across the columns of alignments; related codon-level studies have instead focused on either modeling a single selective context for all codon columns, or a separate selective context for each codon column, with the former strategy deemed too simplistic and the latter deemed overparameterized. Here, we integrate recent developments in nonparametric statistical approaches to propose a probabilistic model that accounts for the heterogeneity of amino acid fitness profiles across the coding positions of a gene. We apply the model to a dozen real protein-coding gene alignments and find it to produce biologically plausible inferences, for instance, as pertaining to site-specific amino acid constraints, as well as distributions of scaled selection coefficients. In their account of mutational features as well as the heterogeneous regimes of selection at the amino acid level, the modeling approaches studied here can form a backdrop for several extensions, accounting for other selective features, for variable population size, or for subtleties of mutational features, all with parameterizations couched within population-genetic theory.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scoring functions, such as molecular mechanic forcefields and statistical potentials are fundamentally important tools in protein structure modeling and quality assessment. RESULTS: The performances of a number of publicly available scoring functions are compared with a statistical rigor, with an emphasis on knowledge-based potentials. We explored the effect on accuracy of alternative choices for representing interaction center types and other features of scoring functions, such as using information on solvent accessibility, on torsion angles, accounting for secondary structure preferences and side chain orientation. Partially based on the observations made, we present a novel residue based statistical potential, which employs a shuffled reference state definition and takes into account the mutual orientation of residue side chains. Atom- and residue-level statistical potentials and Linux executables to calculate the energy of a given protein proposed in this work can be downloaded from http://www.fiserlab.org/potentials. CONCLUSIONS: Among the most influential terms we observed a critical role of a proper reference state definition and the benefits of including information about the microenvironment of interaction centers. Molecular mechanical potentials were also tested and found to be over-sensitive to small local imperfections in a structure, requiring unfeasible long energy relaxation before energy scores started to correlate with model quality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular genetic testing is recommended for diagnosis of inherited cardiac disease, to guide prognosis and treatment, but access is often limited by cost and availability. Recently introduced high-throughput bench-top DNA sequencing platforms have the potential to overcome these limitations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We evaluated two next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms for molecular diagnostics. The protein-coding regions of six genes associated with inherited arrhythmia syndromes were amplified from 15 human samples using parallelised multiplex PCR (Access Array, Fluidigm), and sequenced on the MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent PGM (Life Technologies). Overall, 97.9{\%} of the target was sequenced adequately for variant calling on the MiSeq, and 96.8{\%} on the Ion Torrent PGM. Regions missed tended to be of high GC-content, and most were problematic for both platforms. Variant calling was assessed using 107 variants detected using Sanger sequencing: within adequately sequenced regions, variant calling on both platforms was highly accurate (Sensitivity: MiSeq 100{\%}, PGM 99.1{\%}. Positive predictive value: MiSeq 95.9{\%}, PGM 95.5{\%}). At the time of the study the Ion Torrent PGM had a lower capital cost and individual runs were cheaper and faster. The MiSeq had a higher capacity (requiring fewer runs), with reduced hands-on time and simpler laboratory workflows. Both provide significant cost and time savings over conventional methods, even allowing for adjunct Sanger sequencing to validate findings and sequence exons missed by NGS.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: MiSeq and Ion Torrent PGM both provide accurate variant detection as part of a PCR-based molecular diagnostic workflow, and provide alternative platforms for molecular diagnosis of inherited cardiac conditions. Though there were performance differences at this throughput, platforms differed primarily in terms of cost, scalability, protocol stability and ease of use. Compared with current molecular genetic diagnostic tests for inherited cardiac arrhythmias, these NGS approaches are faster, less expensive, and yet more comprehensive.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing is extensively applied to catalogue somatic mutations in cancer, in research settings and increasingly in clinical settings for molecular diagnostics, guiding therapy decisions. Somatic variant callers perform paired comparisons of sequencing data from cancer tissue and matched normal tissue in order to detect somatic mutations. The advent of many new somatic variant callers creates a need for comparison and validation of the tools, as no de facto standard for detection of somatic mutations exists and only limited comparisons have been reported. We have performed a comprehensive evaluation using exome sequencing and targeted deep sequencing data of paired tumor-normal samples from five breast cancer patients to evaluate the performance of nine publicly available somatic variant callers: EBCall, Mutect, Seurat, Shimmer, Indelocator, Somatic Sniper, Strelka, VarScan 2 and Virmid for the detection of single nucleotide mutations and small deletions and insertions. We report a large variation in the number of calls from the nine somatic variant callers on the same sequencing data and highly variable agreement. Sequencing depth had markedly diverse impact on individual callers, as for some callers, increased sequencing depth highly improved sensitivity. For SNV calling, we report EBCall, Mutect, Virmid and Strelka to be the most reliable somatic variant callers for both exome sequencing and targeted deep sequencing. For indel calling, EBCall is superior due to high sensitivity and robustness to changes in sequencing depths.},

abstract = {The SNAP receptor (SNARE) complex, consisting of synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), synaptobrevin-2, and syntaxin-1, is involved in synaptic vesicles exocytosis. In addition, SNAP-25 has been implicated in constitutive exocytosis processes required for neurite outgrowth. However, at least three isoforms of SNAP-25 have been reported from neurons: SNAP-23, which is also present in non-neuronal cells, and the two alternative splice variants SNAP-25a and SNAP-25b. Here, we studied the differential ability of these isoforms to support the functions previously broadly ascribed to "SNAP-25." We studied the rescue of snap-25 null neurons in culture with different SNAP-25 homologs. We find that deletion of SNAP-25 leads to strongly reduced neuron survival, and, in the few surviving cells, impaired arborization, reduced spontaneous release, and complete arrest of evoked release. Lentiviral expression of SNAP-25a, SNAP-25b, or SNAP-23 rescued neuronal survival, arborization, amplitude, and frequency of spontaneous events. Also evoked release was rescued by all isoforms, but synchronous release required SNAP-25a/b in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. SNAP-23 supported asynchronous release only, reminiscent of synaptotagmin-1 null neurons. SNAP-25b was superior to SNAP-25a in vesicle priming, resembling the shift to larger releasable vesicle pools that accompanies synaptic maturation. These data demonstrate a differential ability of SNAP-25b, SNAP-25a, and SNAP-23 to support neuronal function.},

A representative example is presented, and three experiments are performed that illustrate how the appropriate representation of evolutionary relatedness can improve inferences. We explain why similar improvement can be expected in other secondary structure prediction methods and indeed any comparative sequence analysis method.},

abstract = {Somatic mosaicism occurs throughout normal development and contributes to numerous disease etiologies, including tumorigenesis and neurological disorders. Intratumor genetic heterogeneity is inherent to many cancers, creating challenges for effective treatments. Unfortunately, analysis of bulk DNA masks subclonal phylogenetic architectures created by the acquisition and distribution of somatic mutations amongst cells. As a result, single-cell genetic analysis is becoming recognized as vital for accurately characterizing cancers. Despite this, methods for single-cell genetics are lacking. Here we present an automated microfluidic workflow enabling efficient cell capture, lysis, and whole genome amplification (WGA). We find that {\~{}}90{\%} of the genome is accessible in single cells with improved uniformity relative to current single-cell WGA methods. Allelic dropout (ADO) rates were limited to 13.75{\%} and variant false discovery rates (SNV FDR) were 4.11x10(-6), on average. Application to ER-/PR-/HER2+ breast cancer cells and matched normal controls identified novel mutations that arose in a subpopulation of cells and effectively resolved the segregation of known cancer-related mutations with single-cell resolution. Finally, we demonstrate effective cell classification using mutation profiles with 10X average exome coverage depth per cell. Our data demonstrate an efficient automated microfluidic platform for single-cell WGA that enables the resolution of somatic mutation patterns in single cells.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified loci reproducibly associated with pulmonary diseases; however, the molecular mechanism underlying these associations are largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to discover genetic variants affecting gene expression in human lung tissue, to refine susceptibility loci for asthma identified in GWAS studies, and to use the genetics of gene expression and network analyses to find key molecular drivers of asthma. We performed a genome-wide search for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in 1,111 human lung samples. The lung eQTL dataset was then used to inform asthma genetic studies reported in the literature. The top ranked lung eQTLs were integrated with the GWAS on asthma reported by the GABRIEL consortium to generate a Bayesian gene expression network for discovery of novel molecular pathways underpinning asthma. We detected 17,178 cis- and 593 trans- lung eQTLs, which can be used to explore the functional consequences of loci associated with lung diseases and traits. Some strong eQTLs are also asthma susceptibility loci. For example, rs3859192 on chr17q21 is robustly associated with the mRNA levels of GSDMA (P = 3.55 × 10(-151)). The genetic-gene expression network identified the SOCS3 pathway as one of the key drivers of asthma. The eQTLs and gene networks identified in this study are powerful tools for elucidating the causal mechanisms underlying pulmonary disease. This data resource offers much-needed support to pinpoint the causal genes and characterize the molecular function of gene variants associated with lung diseases.},

  abstract      = {Abstract: Members of the ABC transporter protein family couple ATP binding and hydrolysis to substrate transport, but the mechanism of coupling remains unclear. The canonical domain organization of an ABC protein incorporates two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and two transmembrane domains (TMDs). CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator), a member of this family, includes an additional, unique, regulatory (R) domain. So far, high resolution structure is available for only one of the NBDs of CFTR. Despite its unique characteristics, CFTR's overall structure is believed to resemble that of other ABC transporters. On that assumption, we combined homology modeling with statistical coupling analysis to generate a structural model of CFTR (omitting the R domain) and predict the network of energetically interconnected aminoacids. The TMDs (with their intracellular loops) were modeled on the bacterial multidrug transporter Sav1866, and display its `domain swapped' architecture. The two NBDs with bound ATPs were modeled using several high resolution structures, including those of NBD1 of human CFTR. To minimize modeling artifacts, the target-template sequence alignment was derived from a combined TMD+NBD Pfam alignment containing thousands of ABC protein sequences. We used the same TMD+NBD alignment for statistical coupling analysis, to predict direct and indirect energetic interactions between all possible residue pairs. The resulting matrix was processed by two-way hierarchical clustering to obtain a sparse network of putatively interacting residues. This network, mapped onto the structural model of CFTR, provides a useful framework for future structural, biochemical, and functional investigations.

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is a Cl(-) channel that belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette proteins. The CFTR polypeptide comprises two transmembrane domains, two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), and a regulatory (R) domain. Gating of the channel is controlled by kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the R domain and by ATP binding, and, likely, hydrolysis at the NBDs. Exon 13 of the CFTR gene encodes amino acids (aa's) 590-830, which were originally ascribed to the R domain. In this study, CFTR channels were severed near likely NH(2)- or COOH-terminal boundaries of NBD1. CFTR channel activity, assayed using two-microelectrode voltage clamp and excised patch recordings, provided a sensitive measure of successful assembly of each pair of channel segments as the sever point was systematically shifted along the primary sequence. Substantial channel activity was taken as an indication that NBD1 was functionally intact. This approach revealed that the COOH terminus of NBD1 extends beyond aa 590 and lies between aa's 622 and 634, while the NH(2) terminus of NBD1 lies between aa's 432 and 449. To facilitate biochemical studies of the expressed proteins, a Flag epitope was added to the NH(2) termini of full length CFTR, and of CFTR segments truncated before the normal COOH terminus (aa 1480). The functionally identified NBD1 boundaries are supported by Western blotting, coimmunoprecipitation, and deglycosylation studies, which showed that an NH(2)-terminal segment representing aa's 3-622 (Flag3-622) or 3-633 (Flag3-633) could physically associate with a COOH-terminal fragment representing aa's 634-1480 (634-1480); however, the latter fragment was glycosylated to the mature form only in the presence of Flag3-633. Similarly, 433-1480 could physically associate with Flag3-432 and was glycosylated to the mature form; however, 449-1480 protein seemed unstable and could hardly be detected even when expressed with Flag3-432. In excised-patch recordings, all functional severed CFTR channels displayed the hallmark characteristics of CFTR, including the requirement of phosphorylation and exposure to MgATP for gating, ability to be locked open by pyrophosphate or AMP-PNP, small single channel conductances, and high apparent affinity of channel opening by MgATP. Our definitions of the boundaries of the NBD1 domain in CFTR are supported by comparison with the solved NBD structures of HisP and RbsA.},

We define a tetrahedral entropy S (Q) associated with the local tetrahedral order of water molecules and find that it produces a major contribution to the specific heat maximum at the Widom line.

Here, we introduce a new functional impact score (FIS) for amino acid residue changes using evolutionary conservation patterns. The information in these patterns is derived from aligned families and sub-families of sequence homologs within and between species using combinatorial entropy formalism. The score performs well on a large set of human protein mutations in separating disease-associated variants (∼19 200), assumed to be strongly functional, from common polymorphisms (∼35 600), assumed to be weakly functional (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of ∼0.86). In cancer, using recurrence, multiplicity and annotation for ∼10 000 mutations in the COSMIC database, the method does well in assigning higher scores to more likely functional mutations ('drivers'). To guide experimental prioritization, we report a list of about 1000 top human cancer genes frequently mutated in one or more cancer types ranked by likely functional impact; and, an additional 1000 candidate cancer genes with rare but likely functional mutations. In addition, we estimate that at least 5{\%} of cancer-relevant mutations involve switch of function, rather than simply loss or gain of function.},

One component of the model describes the organization of secondary structure along a protein sequence and another specifies the evolutionary process for each category of secondary structure. A database of proteins with known secondary structures is used to estimate model parameters representing these two components. Phylogeny, the third component of the model, can be estimated from the data set of interest. As an example, we employ our model to analyze a set of sucrose synthase sequences. For the evolution of sucrose synthase, a parametric bootstrap approach indicates that our model is statistically preferable to one that ignores secondary structure.},

abstract = {Large-scale sequencing in the 1000 Genomes Project has revealed multitudes of single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Here, we provide insights into the functional effect of these variants using allele-specific behaviour. This can be assessed for an individual by mapping ChIP-seq and RNA-seq reads to a personal genome, and then measuring 'allelic imbalances' between the numbers of reads mapped to the paternal and maternal chromosomes. We annotate variants associated with allele-specific binding and expression in 382 individuals by uniformly processing 1,263 functional genomics data sets, developing approaches to reduce the heterogeneity between data sets due to overdispersion and mapping bias. Since many allelic variants are rare, aggregation across multiple individuals is necessary to identify broadly applicable 'allelic elements'. We also found SNVs for which we can anticipate allelic imbalance from the disruption of a binding motif. Our results serve as an allele-specific annotation for the 1000 Genomes variant catalogue and are distributed as an online resource (alleledb.gersteinlab.org).},

In order to associate each miRNA to a specific functionality it is essential to unveil the rules that govern miRNA action. Despite the fact that there has been significant improvement exposing structural characteristics of the miRNA-mRNA interaction, the entire physical mechanism is not yet fully understood. In this respect, the development of computational algorithms for miRNA target prediction becomes increasingly important. This manuscript summarizes the research done on miRNA target prediction.

To this end, we take a new approach in this pedagogical review of the statistical mechanics of protein folding. The benefit of our approach is a drastic mathematical simplification of the theory, without resort to any new approximations or phenomenological prescriptions. Indeed, the results we obtain agree precisely with previous calculations. Because of this simplification, we are able to present here a thorough and self contained treatment of the problem. Topics discussed include the statistical mechanics of the random energy model (REM), tests of the validity of REM as a model for heteropolymer freezing, freezing transition of random sequences, phase diagram of designed ("minimally frustrated") sequences, and the degree to which errors in the interactions employed in simulations of either folding and design can still lead to correct folding behavior.},

Beyond confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, AKT1, GATA3 and MAP3K1, we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in triple-negative breast cancer lacking oestrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput omics technologies such as microarrays and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have become indispensable tools in biological research. Computational analysis and biological interpretation of omics data can pose significant challenges due to a number of factors, in particular the systems integration required to fully exploit and compare data from different studies and/or technology platforms. In transcriptomics, the identification of differentially expressed genes when studying effect(s) or contrast(s) of interest constitutes the starting point for further downstream computational analysis (e.g. gene over-representation/enrichment analysis, reverse engineering) leading to mechanistic insights. Therefore, it is important to systematically store the full list of genes with their associated statistical analysis results (differential expression, t-statistics, p-value) corresponding to one or more effect(s) or contrast(s) of interest (shortly termed as " contrast data") in a comparable manner and extract gene sets in order to efficiently support downstream analyses and further leverage data on a long-term basis. Filling this gap would open new research perspectives for biologists to discover disease-related biomarkers and to support the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying specific biological perturbation effects (e.g. disease, genetic, environmental, etc.).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To address these challenges, we developed Confero, a contrast data and gene set platform for downstream analysis and biological interpretation of omics data. The Confero software platform provides storage of contrast data in a simple and standard format, data transformation to enable cross-study and platform data comparison, and automatic extraction and storage of gene sets to build new a priori knowledge which is leveraged by integrated and extensible downstream computational analysis tools. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Over-Representation Analysis (ORA) are currently integrated as an analysis module as well as additional tools to support biological interpretation. Confero is a standalone system that also integrates with Galaxy, an open-source workflow management and data integration system. To illustrate Confero platform functionality we walk through major aspects of the Confero workflow and results using the Bioconductor estrogen package dataset.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Confero provides a unique and flexible platform to support downstream computational analysis facilitating biological interpretation. The system has been designed in order to provide the researcher with a simple, innovative, and extensible solution to store and exploit analyzed data in a sustainable and reproducible manner thereby accelerating knowledge-driven research. Confero source code is freely available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/confero/.},

Due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based research through the distribution of freely available software.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function; however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB to facilitate use of legacy codes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Parent-of-origin-dependent expression of alleles, imprinting, has been suggested to impact a substantial proportion of mammalian genes. Its discovery requires allele-specific detection of expressed transcripts, but in some cases detected allelic expression bias has been interpreted as imprinting without demonstrating compatible transmission patterns and excluding heritable variation. Therefore, we utilized a genome-wide tool exploiting high density genotyping arrays in parallel measurements of genotypes in RNA and DNA to determine allelic expression across the transcriptome in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and skin fibroblasts derived from families. RESULTS We were able to validate 43{\%} of imprinted genes with previous demonstration of compatible transmission patterns in LCLs and fibroblasts. In contrast, we only validated 8{\%} of genes suggested to be imprinted in the literature, but without clear evidence of parent-of-origin-determined expression. We also detected five novel imprinted genes and delineated regions of imprinted expression surrounding annotated imprinted genes. More subtle parent-of-origin-dependent expression, or partial imprinting, could be verified in four genes. Despite higher prevalence of monoallelic expression, immortalized LCLs showed consistent imprinting in fewer loci than primary cells. Random monoallelic expression has previously been observed in LCLs and we show that random monoallelic expression in LCLs can be partly explained by aberrant methylation in the genome. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that widespread parent-of-origin-dependent expression observed recently in rodents is unlikely to be captured by assessment of human cells derived from adult tissues where genome-wide assessment of both primary and immortalized cells yields few new imprinted loci.},

Similar results were obtained for the hairpin and helices by using different potentials.

abstract = {Markovian models of protein evolution that relax the assumption of independent change among codons are considered. With this comparatively realistic framework, an evolutionary rate at a site can depend both on the state of the site and on the states of surrounding sites. By allowing a relatively general dependence structure among sites, models of evolution can reflect attributes of tertiary structure. To quantify the impact of protein structure on protein evolution, we analyze protein-coding DNA sequence pairs with an evolutionary model that incorporates effects of solvent accessibility and pairwise interactions among amino acid residues. By explicitly considering the relationship between nonsynonymous substitution rates and protein structure, this approach can lead to refined detection and characterization of positive selection. Analyses of simulated sequence pairs indicate that parameters in this evolutionary model can be well estimated. Analyses of lysozyme c and annexin V sequence pairs yield the biologically reasonable result that amino acid replacement rates are higher when the replacements lead to energetically favorable proteins than when they destabilize the proteins. Although the focus here is evolutionary dependence among codons that is associated with protein structure, the statistical approach is quite general and could be applied to diverse cases of evolutionary dependence where surrogates for sequence fitness can be measured or modeled.},

abstract = {Gating of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) involves a coordinated action of ATP on two nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). Previous studies using nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues and NBD mutant CFTR have suggested that nucleotide hydrolysis at NBD1 is required for opening of the channel, while hydrolysis of nucleotides at NBD2 controls channel closing. We studied ATP-dependent gating of CFTR in excised inside-out patches from stably transfected NIH3T3 cells. Single channel kinetics of CFTR gating at different [ATP] were analyzed. The closed time constant (tauc) decreased with increasing [ATP] to a minimum value of approximately 0.43 s at [ATP] {\textgreater}1.00 mM. The open time constant (tauo) increased with increasing [ATP] with a minimal tauo of approximately 260 ms. Kinetic analysis of K1250A-CFTR, a mutant that abolishes ATP hydrolysis at NBD2, reveals the presence of two open states. A short open state with a time constant of approximately 250 ms is dominant at low ATP concentrations (10 microM) and a much longer open state with a time constant of approximately 3 min is present at millimolar ATP. These data suggest that nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at NBD1 is coupled to channel opening and that the channel can close without nucleotide interaction with NBD2. A quantitative cyclic gating scheme with microscopic irreversibility was constructed based on the kinetic parameters derived from single-channel analysis. The estimated values of the kinetic parameters suggest that NBD1 and NBD2 are neither functionally nor biochemically equivalent.},

abstract = {Protein kinase A (PKA) is a key regulator of neurosecretion, but the molecular targets remain elusive. We combined pharmacological manipulations of kinase and phosphatase activities with mutational studies on the exocytotic machinery driving fusion of catecholamine-containing vesicles from chromaffin cells. We found that constitutive PKA activity was necessary to maintain a large number of vesicles in the release-ready, so-called primed, state, whereas calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B) activity antagonized this effect. Overexpression of the SNARE protein SNAP-25a mutated in a PKA phosphorylation site (Thr-138) eliminated the effect of PKA inhibitors on the vesicle priming process. Another, unidentified, PKA target regulated the relative size of two different primed vesicle pools that are distinguished by their release kinetics. Overexpression of the SNAP-25b isoform increased the size of both primed vesicle pools by a factor of two, and mutations in the conserved Thr-138 site had similar effects as in the a isoform.},

We aim to test the diagnostic accuracy of current NGS technology in the analysis of mutations that represent current standard-of-care, and its reliability to generate concomitant information on other key genes in human oncogenesis. Thirteen clinical samples (8 lung adenocarcinomas, 3 colon carcinomas and 2 malignant melanomas) already genotyped for EGFR, KRAS and BRAF mutations by current standard-of-care methods (Sanger Sequencing and q-PCR), were analysed for detection of mutations in the same three genes using two NGS platforms and an additional 43 genes with one of these platforms. The results were analysed using closed platform-specific proprietary bioinformatics software as well as open third party applications. Our results indicate that the existing format of the NGS technology performed well in detecting the clinically relevant mutations stated above but may not be reliable for a broader unsupervised analysis of the wider genome in its current design. Our study represents a diagnostically lead validation of the major strengths and weaknesses of this technology before consideration for diagnostic use.},

abstract = {An information theoretic approach is used to examine the magnitude and origin of associations among amino acid sites in the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. Entropy and mutual information values are used to summarize the variability and covariability of amino acids comprising the bHLH domain for 242 sequences. When these quantitative measures are integrated with crystal structure data and summarized using helical wheels, they provide important insights into the evolution of three-dimensional structure in these proteins. We show that amino acid sites in the bHLH domain known to pack against each other have very low entropy values, indicating little residue diversity at these contact sites. Noncontact sites, on the other hand, exhibit significantly larger entropy values, as well as statistically significant levels of mutual information or association among sites. High levels of mutual information indicate significant amounts of intercorrelation among amino acid residues at these various sites. Using computer simulations based on a parametric bootstrap procedure, we are able to partition the observed covariation among various amino acid sites into that arising from phylogenetic (common ancestry) and stochastic causes and those resulting from structural and functional constraints. These results show that a significant amount of the observed covariation among amino acid sites is due to structural/functional constraints, over and above the covariation arising from phylogenetic constraints. These quantitative analyses provide a highly integrated evolutionary picture of the multidimensional dynamics of sequence diversity and protein structure.},

Examination of candidate genes at these loci suggests the involvement of neuronal calcium signaling. We estimate that 8,300 independent, mostly common SNPs (95{\%} credible interval of 6,300-10,200 SNPs) contribute to risk for schizophrenia and that these collectively account for at least 32{\%} of the variance in liability.

abstract = {Heritability analyses of genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohorts have yielded important insights into complex disease architecture, and increasing sample sizes hold the promise of further discoveries. Here we analyze the genetic architectures of schizophrenia in 49,806 samples from the PGC and nine complex diseases in 54,734 samples from the GERA cohort. For schizophrenia, we infer an overwhelmingly polygenic disease architecture in which ≥71{\%} of 1-Mb genomic regions harbor ≥1 variant influencing schizophrenia risk. We also observe significant enrichment of heritability in GC-rich regions and in higher-frequency SNPs for both schizophrenia and GERA diseases. In bivariate analyses, we observe significant genetic correlations (ranging from 0.18 to 0.85) for several pairs of GERA diseases; genetic correlations were on average 1.3 tunes stronger than the correlations of overall disease liabilities. To accomplish these analyses, we developed a fast algorithm for multicomponent, multi-trait variance-components analysis that overcomes prior computational barriers that made such analyses intractable at this scale.},

abstract = {Over the past several years it has become clear that alterations in the expression of microRNA (miRNA) genes contribute to the pathogenesis of most - if not all - human malignancies. These alterations can be caused by various mechanisms, including deletions, amplifications or mutations involving miRNA loci, epigenetic silencing or the dysregulation of transcription factors that target specific miRNAs. Because malignant cells show dependence on the dysregulated expression of miRNA genes, which in turn control or are controlled by the dysregulation of multiple protein-coding oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes, these small RNAs provide important opportunities for the development of future miRNA-based therapies.},

abstract = {For cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl- channels to open, they must be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and then exposed to a hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphate, such as ATP. To test whether channel opening is linked to ATP hydrolysis, we applied VO4 and BeF3 to CFTR channels in inside-out patches excised from cardiac myocytes. These inorganic phosphate analogs interrupt ATP hydrolysis cycles by binding tightly in place of the released hydrolysis product, inorganic phosphate. The analogs acted only on CFTR channels opened by ATP and locked them open, increasing their mean open time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These findings establish that opening and closing of CFTR channels are coupled to an ATP hydrolysis cycle.},

abstract = {Predicting functional amino acid residues in silico is important for comparative genomics. In this paper, we focus on the issue of how to statistically identify cluster-specific amino acid residues that are related to the functional divergence after gene duplication. We approach this problem using a framework based on site-specific shift of amino acid property (type-II functional divergence), as opposed to site-specific shift of evolutionary rate (type-I functional divergence). An efficient statistical procedure is implemented to facilitate the development of phylogenomic database for cluster-specific residues of large-scale protein families. Our method has the following features: 1) statistical testing of the type-II functional divergence and 2) the site-specific Bayesian profile to measure how amino acid residues contribute to type-II (cluster-specific) functional divergence. Consequently, one may obtain the posterior probability for "functional" cluster-specific residues. Case studies are presented and indicate that radical cluster-specific residues are responsible for most of inferred type-II functional divergence, whereas conserved cluster-specific residues appear less than even those imperfect radical cluster-specific residues to this type of functional divergence.},

However, approaches based on the selection of individual sequences have not been entirely successful at the quantitative description of the distribution of structures and sequences in the protein universe because evolutionary pressure acts on the entire organism, rather than on a particular molecule. In parallel to this line of study, studies in population genetics and phenomenological molecular evolution established a mathematical framework to describe the changes in genome sequences in populations of organisms over time. Here, we review both microscopic (physics-based) and macroscopic (organism-level) models of protein-sequence evolution and demonstrate that bridging the two scales provides the most complete description of the protein universe starting from clearly defined, testable, and physiologically relevant assumptions.},

abstract = {Epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as links between prenatal environmental exposure and disease risk later in life. Here, we studied epigenetic changes associated with maternal smoking at base pair resolution by mappingDNAmethylation, histone modifications, and transcription in expectant mothers and their newborn children. We found extensive global differential methylation and carefully evaluated these changes to separate environment associated from genotype-relatedDNAmethylation changes. Differential methylation is enriched in enhancer elements and targets in particular "commuting" enhancers having multiple, regulatory interactions with distal genes. Longitudinal whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed thatDNAmethylation changes associated with maternal smoking persist over years of life. Particularly in children prenatal environmental exposure leads to chromatin transitions into a hyperactive state. CombinedDNAmethylation, histone modification, and gene expression analyses indicate that differential methylation in enhancer regions is more often functionally translated than methylation changes in promoters or non-regulatory elements. Finally, we show that epigenetic deregulation of a commuting enhancer targeting c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) is linked to impaired lung function in early childhood.},

@article{Hegedus:2008,
abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-dependent chloride channel that is mutated in cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease of high morbidity and mortality. The phosphorylation of its approximately 200 amino acid R domain by protein kinase A is obligatory for channel gating under normal conditions. The R domain contains more than ten PKA phosphorylation sites. No individual site is essential but phosphorylation of increasing numbers of sites enables progressively greater channel activity. In spite of numerous studies of the role of the R domain in CFTR regulation, its mechanism of action remains largely unknown. This is because neither its structure nor its interactions with other parts of CFTR have been completely elucidated. Studies have shown that the R domain lacks well-defined secondary structural elements and is an intrinsically disordered region of the channel protein. Here, we have analyzed the disorder pattern and employed computational methods to explore low-energy conformations of the R domain. The specific disorder and secondary structure patterns detected suggest the presence of molecular recognition elements (MoREs) that may mediate phosphorylation-regulated intra- and inter-domain interactions. Simulations were performed to generate an ensemble of accessible R domain conformations. Although the calculated structures may represent more compact conformers than occur in vivo, their secondary structure propensities are consistent with predictions and published experimental data. Equilibrium simulations of a mimic of a phosphorylated R domain showed that it exhibited an increased radius of gyration. In one possible interpretation of these findings, by changing its size, the globally unstructured R domain may act as an entropic spring to perturb the packing of membrane-spanning sequences that constitute the ion permeability pathway and thereby activate channel gating.},

Our map encompassed 22,025 deletions and 6,000 additional SVs, including insertions and tandem duplications. Most SVs (53{\%}) were mapped to nucleotide resolution, which facilitated analysing their origin and functional impact. We examined numerous whole and partial gene deletions with a genotyping approach and observed a depletion of gene disruptions amongst high frequency deletions. Furthermore, we observed differences in the size spectra of SVs originating from distinct formation mechanisms, and constructed a map of SV hotspots formed by common mechanisms. Our analytical framework and SV map serves as a resource for sequencing-based association studies.},

Unfortunately, in complex problems (e.g., split-plot designs), it is not always easy to set up an appropriate ANOVA. We propose a hierarchical analysis that automatically gives the correct ANOVA comparisons even in complex scenarios. The inferences for all means and variances are performed under a model with a separate batch of effects for each row of the ANOVA table. We connect to classical ANOVA by working with finite-sample variance components: fixed and random effects models are characterized by inferences about existing levels of a factor and new levels, respectively. We also introduce a new graphical display showing inferences about the standard deviations of each batch of effects. We illustrate with two examples from our applied data analysis, first illustrating the usefulness of our hierarchical computations and displays, and second showing how the ideas of ANOVA are helpful in understanding a previously fit hierarchical model.},

abstract = {The Na+/K+ pump, a P-type ion-motive ATPase, exports three sodium ions and then imports two potassium ions in each transport cycle. Ions on one side of the membrane bind to sites within the protein and become temporarily occluded (trapped within the protein) before being released to the other side, but details of these occlusion and de-occlusion transitions remain obscure for all P-type ATPases. If it is deprived of potassium ions, the Na+/K+ pump is restricted to sodium translocation steps, at least one involving charge movement through the membrane's electric fields. Changes in membrane potential alter the rate of such electrogenic reactions and so shift the distribution of enzyme conformations. Here we use high-speed voltage jumps to initiate this redistribution and show that the resulting pre-steady-state charge movements relax in three identifiable phases, apparently reflecting de-occlusion and release of the three sodium ions. Reciprocal relationships among the sizes of these three charge components show that the three sodium ions are de-occluded and released to the extracellular solution one at a time, in a strict order.},

Some non-coding regions exhibited high mutation frequencies, but most have distinctive structural features probably causing elevated mutation rates and do not contain driver mutations. Mutational signature analysis was extended to genome rearrangements and revealed twelve base substitution and six rearrangement signatures. Three rearrangement signatures, characterized by tandem duplications or deletions, appear associated with defective homologous-recombination-based DNA repair: one with deficient BRCA1 function, another with deficient BRCA1 or BRCA2 function, the cause of the third is unknown. This analysis of all classes of somatic mutation across exons, introns and intergenic regions highlights the repertoire of cancer genes and mutational processes operating, and progresses towards a comprehensive account of the somatic genetic basis of breast cancer.},

abstract = {Since the early days of molecular evolution, the conventional wisdom has been that the evolution of protein-coding genes is primarily determined by functional constraints. Yet recent evidence indicates that the evolution of these genes is strongly shaped by the biophysical processes of protein synthesis, protein folding, and specific as well as nonspecific protein-protein interactions. Selection pressures related to these biophysical processes affect primarily the amino-acid sequence of genes, but they also leave their mark on synonymous sites at the nucleotide level. While evidence for specific selection pressures related to protein biophysics is strong, there is currently no unifying framework that integrates the various selection pressures on coding sequences and disentangles their relative importance.},

abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing.In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues., including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7-4.8 {\{}{\AA}{\}} C($\alpha$)-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that causes considerable morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal cost(1). Genetic factors have been strongly implicated via family and twin data, and more recently directly through Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and exome sequencing studies(2). Some of the most potent genetic risk factors for SCZ include de novo, heterozygous copy number variants(3) (CNVs) and rare loss-of-function single nucleotide variants(4-8) (SNVs). In many disorders caused by de novo mutations a portion of those mutations occur after fertilization, i.e., are somatic mosaic mutations, and thus present only in cells that are progeny of the originally mutated cell. For example, in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) mosaic mutations in MECP2, FMR1, TSC1/2, SCN1A/2A (9) have all been reported. Many rare variants known to increase risk of ASD, and in particular de novo variants, are enriched in SCZ (10). These shared genetic risk factors suggest that SCZ maybe have a contribution of somatic mosaicism as well, yet we lack any data about the relative proportion o},

abstract = {Somatic mutations must happen often during development because of the large number of cell divisions to expand from a single-cell zygote to a full organism. A mutation in development carries forward to all descendant cells, causing genetic mosaicism. Widespread genetic mosaicism may influence diseases that derive from a few genetically altered cells, such as cancer. I show how to predict the expected amount of mosaicism and the variation in mosaicism between individuals. I then calculate the predicted risk of cancer derived from developmental mutations. The calculations show that a significant fraction of cancer in later life likely arises from developmental mutations in early life. In addition, much of the variation in the risk of cancer between individuals may arise from variation in the degree of genetic mosaicism set in early life. I also suggest that certain types of neurodegeneration, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), may derive from a small focus of genetically altered cells. If so, then the risk of ALS would be influenced by developmental mutations and the consequent variation in genetic mosaicism. New technologies promise the ability to measure genetic mosaicism by sampling a large number of cellular genomes within an individual. The sampling of many genomes within an individual will eventually allow one to reconstruct the cell lineage history of genetic change in a single body. Somatic evolutionary genomics will follow from this technology, providing new insight into the origin and progression of disease with increasing age.},

We applied this method to sequence single normal and tumour nuclei from an oestrogen-receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer and a triple-negative ductal carcinoma. In parallel, we performed single nuclei copy number profiling. Our data show that aneuploid rearrangements occurred early in tumour evolution and remained highly stable as the tumour masses clonally expanded. In contrast, point mutations evolved gradually, generating extensive clonal diversity. Using targeted single-molecule sequencing, many of the diverse mutations were shown to occur at low frequencies ({\textless}10{\%}) in the tumour mass. Using mathematical modelling we found that the triple-negative tumour cells had an increased mutation rate (13.3×), whereas the ER(+) tumour cells did not.

abstract = {The network of native non-covalent residue contacts determines the three-dimensional structure of a protein. However, not all contacts are of equal structural significance, and little knowledge exists about a minimal, yet sufficient, subset required to define the global features of a protein. Characterisation of this "structural essence" has remained elusive so far: no algorithmic strategy has been devised to-date that could outperform a random selection in terms of 3D reconstruction accuracy (measured as the Ca RMSD). It is not only of theoretical interest (i.e., for design of advanced statistical potentials) to identify the number and nature of essential native contacts-such a subset of spatial constraints is very useful in a number of novel experimental methods (like EPR) which rely heavily on constraint-based protein modelling. To derive accurate three-dimensional models from distance constraints, we implemented a reconstruction pipeline using distance geometry. We selected a test-set of 12 protein structures from the four major SCOP fold classes and performed our reconstruction analysis. As a reference set, series of random subsets (ranging from 10{\%} to 90{\%} of native contacts) are generated for each protein, and the reconstruction accuracy is computed for each subset. We have developed a rational strategy, termed "cone-peeling" that combines sequence features and network descriptors to select minimal subsets that outperform the reference sets. We present, for the first time, a rational strategy to derive a structural essence of residue contacts and provide an estimate of the size of this minimal subset. Our algorithm computes sparse subsets capable of determining the tertiary structure at approximately 4.8 A Ca RMSD with as little as 8{\%} of the native contacts (Ca-Ca and Cb-Cb). At the same time, a randomly chosen subset of native contacts needs about twice as many contacts to reach the same level of accuracy. This "structural essence" opens new avenues in the fields of structure prediction, empirical potentials and docking.},

abstract = {Whole-cell currents were recorded in guinea pig ventricular myocytes at approximately 36 degrees C before, during, and after exposure to maximally effective concentrations of strophanthidin, a cardiotonic steroid and specific inhibitor of the Na/K pump. Wide-tipped pipettes, in combination with a device for exchanging the solution inside the pipette, afforded reasonable control of the ionic composition of the intracellular solution and of the membrane potential. Internal and external solutions were designed to minimize channel currents and Na/Ca exchange current while sustaining vigorous forward Na/K transport, monitored as strophanthidin-sensitive current. 100-ms voltage pulses from the -40 mV holding potential were used to determine steady-state levels of membrane current between -140 and +60 mV. Control experiments demonstrated that if the Na/K pump cycle were first arrested, e.g., by withdrawal of external K, or of both internal and external Na, then neither strophanthidin nor its vehicle, dimethylsulfoxide, had any discernible effect on steady-state membrane current. Further controls showed that, with the Na/K pump inhibited by strophanthidin, membrane current was insensitive to changes of external [K] between 5.4 and 0 mM and was little altered by changing the pipette [Na] from 0 to 50 mM. Strophanthidin-sensitive current therefore closely approximated Na/K pump current, and was virtually free of contamination by current components altered by the changes in extracellular [K] and intracellular [Na] expected to accompany pump inhibition. The steady-state Na/K pump current-voltage (I-V) relationship, with the pump strongly activated by 5.4 mM external K and 50 mM internal Na (and 10 mM ATP), was sigmoid in shape with a steep positive slope between about 0 and -100 mV, a less steep slope at more negative potentials, and an extremely shallow slope at positive potentials; no region of negative slope was found. That shape of I-V relationship can be generated by a two-state cycle with one pair of voltage-sensitive rate constants and one pair of voltage-insensitive rate constants: such a two-state scheme is a valid steady-state representation of a multi-state cycle that includes only a single voltage-sensitive step.},

abstract = {It has been known for some time that many proteins are marginally stable. This has inspired several explanations. Having noted that the functionality of many enzymes is correlated with subunit motion, flexibility, or general disorder, some have suggested that marginally stable proteins should have an evolutionary advantage over proteins of differing stability. Others have suggested that stability and functionality are contradictory qualities, and that selection for both criteria results in marginally stable proteins, optimised to satisfy the competing design pressures. While these explanations are plausible, recent research simulating the evolution of model proteins has shown that selection for stability, ignoring any aspects of functionality, can result in marginally stable proteins because of the underlying makeup of protein sequence-space. We extend this research by simulating the evolution of proteins, using a computational protein model that equates functionality with binding and catalysis. In the model, marginal stability is not required for ligand-binding functionality and we observe no competing design pressures. The resulting proteins are marginally stable, again demonstrating that neutral evolution is sufficient for explaining marginal stability in observed proteins.},

The features characterizing each miRNA recognition element include binding structure, conservation level, and a specific profile of structural accessibility. The ANN is trained to integrate the features of each recognition element along the 3'untranslated region into a targeting score, reproducing the relative repression fold change of the protein. Tested on two different sets the algorithm outperforms other widely used algorithms and also predicts a significant number of unique and reliable targets not predicted by the other methods. For 542 human miRNAs DIANA-microT-ANN predicts 120000 targets not provided by TargetScan 5.0. The algorithm is freely available at http://microrna.gr/microT-ANN.},

A broad range of transcribed and regulatory nonconserved elements show decreased human diversity, suggesting lineage-specific purifying selection. Conversely, conserved elements lacking activity show increased human diversity, suggesting that some recently became nonfunctional. Regulatory elements under human constraint in nonconserved regions were found near color vision and nerve-growth genes, consistent with purifying selection for recently evolved functions.

abstract = {The human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a chloride channel, whose dysfunction causes cystic fibrosis. To gain structural insight into the dynamic interaction between CFTR's nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) proposed to underlie channel gating, we introduced target cysteines into the NBDs, expressed the channels in Xenopus oocytes, and used in vivo sulfhydryl-specific crosslinking to directly examine the cysteines' proximity. We tested five cysteine pairs, each comprising one introduced cysteine in the NH(2)-terminal NBD1 and another in the COOH-terminal NBD2. Identification of crosslinked product was facilitated by co-expression of NH(2)-terminal and COOH-terminal CFTR half channels each containing one NBD. The COOH-terminal half channel lacked all native cysteines. None of CFTR's 18 native cysteines was found essential for wild type-like, phosphorylation- and ATP-dependent, channel gating. The observed crosslinks demonstrate that NBD1 and NBD2 interact in a head-to-tail configuration analogous to that in homodimeric crystal structures of nucleotide-bound prokaryotic NBDs. CFTR phosphorylation by PKA strongly promoted both crosslinking and opening of the split channels, firmly linking head-to-tail NBD1-NBD2 association to channel opening.},

This has been illustrated in a number of experimental models and the fact that both decreased (or complete loss) and increased imprinted gene expression can lead to human diseases. In the present paper, we discuss the consequence of increased dosage of imprinted genes for brain function, focusing on the PWS (Prader–Willi syndrome) locus on human chromosome 15q11–q13 and how predicted increases in dosage of maternally expressed imprinted genes from this interval are associated with a higher risk of developing psychotic illness. The evidence for this comes from individuals with PWS itself and also non-syndromic cases of psychosis in carriers of a maternally derived copy number variant spanning this locus. Of the known imprinted genes in this region, the prime candidate is maternally expressed UBE3A, which encodes E6-AP (E6-associated protein) ubiquitin ligase and has an influence on a number of important neurotransmitter systems. Furthermore, these findings point to the fact that brain function is exquisitely sensitive to both decreases and increases in the expression of imprinted genes.},

@article{Zwemer2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Random monoallelic expression defines an unusual class of genes displaying random choice for expression between the maternal and paternal alleles. Once established, the allele-specific expression pattern is stably maintained and mitotically inherited. Examples of random monoallelic genes include those found on the X-chromosome and a subset of autosomal genes, which have been most extensively studied in humans. Here, we report a genome-wide analysis of random monoallelic expression in the mouse. We used high density mouse genome polymorphism mapping arrays to assess allele-specific expression in clonal cell lines derived from heterozygous mouse strains. RESULTS Over 1,300 autosomal genes were assessed for allele-specific expression, and greater than 10{\%} of them showed random monoallelic expression. When comparing mouse and human, the number of autosomal orthologs demonstrating random monoallelic expression in both organisms was greater than would be expected by chance. Random monoallelic expression on the mouse autosomes is broadly similar to that in human cells: it is widespread throughout the genome, lacks chromosome-wide coordination, and varies between cell types. However, for some mouse genes, there appears to be skewing, in some ways resembling skewed X-inactivation, wherein one allele is more frequently active. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that autosomal random monoallelic expression was present at least as far back as the last common ancestor of rodents and primates. Random monoallelic expression can lead to phenotypic variation beyond the phenotypic variation dictated by genotypic variation. Thus, it is important to take into account random monoallelic expression when examining genotype-phenotype correlation.},

However, understanding of the sources of technical and interlaboratory variation is still limited. To address this, the GEUVADIS consortium sequenced mRNAs and small RNAs of lymphoblastoid cell lines of 465 individuals in seven sequencing centers, with a large number of replicates. The variation between laboratories appeared to be considerably smaller than the already limited biological variation. Laboratory effects were mainly seen in differences in insert size and GC content and could be adequately corrected for. In small-RNA sequencing, the microRNA (miRNA) content differed widely between samples owing to competitive sequencing of rRNA fragments. This did not affect relative quantification of miRNAs. We conclude that distributing RNA sequencing among different laboratories is feasible, given proper standardization and randomization procedures. We provide a set of quality measures and guidelines for assessing technical biases in RNA-seq data.},

Kin selection theory provides a framework for analyzing such effects because an individual's longevity and mortality schedule may alter its inclusive fitness via effects on the fitness of relatives. Kin-selected effects on aging have been demonstrated both by models of intergenerational transfers of investment by caregivers and by spatially explicit population models with limited dispersal. They also underlie coevolution between the degree and form of sociality and patterns of aging. In this review I critically examine and synthesize theory and data concerning these processes. I propose a classification, stemming from kin selection theory, of social effects on aging and describe a hypothesis for kin-selected conflict over parental time of death in systems with resource inheritance.

Our study uncovers hundreds of noncanonical autosomal and X-linked imprinting effects. Noncanonical imprinting is highly tissue-specific and enriched in the ARN, but rare in the liver. These effects are reproducible across different genetic backgrounds and associated with allele-specific chromatin. Using in situ hybridization for nascent RNAs, we discover that autosomal noncanonical imprinted genes with a tissue-level allele bias exhibit allele-specific expression effects in subpopulations of neurons in the brain in vivo. We define noncanonical imprinted genes that regulate monoamine signaling and determine that these effects influence the impact of inherited mutations on offspring behavior.},

  abstract      = {Genomic imprinting refers to the parent-of-origin-specific epigenetic marking of a number of genes. This epigenetic mark leads to a bias in expression between maternally and paternally inherited imprinted genes, that in some cases results in monoallelic expression from one parental allele. Genomic imprinting is often thought to have evolved as a consequence of the intragenomic conflict between the parental alleles that occurs whenever there is an asymmetry of relatedness. The two main examples of asymmetry of relatedness are when there is partiality of parental investment in offspring (as is the case for placental mammals, where there is also the possibility of extended postnatal care by one parent), and in social groups where there is a sex-biased dispersal. From this evolutionary starting point, it is predicted that, at the behavioural level, imprinted genes will influence what can broadly be termed bonding and social behaviour. We examine the animal and human literature for examples of imprinted genes mediating these behaviours, and divide them into two general classes. Firstly, mother-offspring interactions (suckling, attachment and maternal behaviours) that are predicted to occur when partiality in parental investment in early postnatal offspring occurs; and secondly, adult social interactions, when there is an asymmetry of relatedness in social groups. Finally, we return to the evolutionary theory and examine whether there is a pattern of behavioural functions mediated by imprinted genes emerging from the limited data, and also whether any tangible predictions can be made with regards to the direction of action of genes of maternal or paternal origin.},

  abstract      = {Genotyping of classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles is an essential tool in the analysis of diseases and adverse drug reactions with associations mapping to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). However, deriving high-resolution HLA types subsequent to whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing or sequencing is often cost prohibitive for large samples. An alternative approach takes advantage of the extended haplotype structure within the MHC to predict HLA alleles using dense SNP genotypes, such as those available from genome-wide SNP panels. Current methods for HLA imputation are difficult to apply or may require the user to have access to large training data sets with SNP and HLA types. We propose HIBAG, HLA Imputation using attribute BAGging, that makes predictions by averaging HLA-type posterior probabilities over an ensemble of classifiers built on bootstrap samples. We assess the performance of HIBAG using our study data (n=2668 subjects of European ancestry) as a training set and HLA data from the British 1958 birth cohort study (n≈1000 subjects) as independent validation samples. Prediction accuracies for HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 range from 92.2{\%} to 98.1{\%} using a set of SNP markers common to the Illumina 1M Duo, OmniQuad, OmniExpress, 660K and 550K platforms. HIBAG performed well compared with the other two leading methods, HLA*IMP and BEAGLE. This method is implemented in a freely available HIBAG R package that includes pre-fit classifiers for European, Asian, Hispanic and African ancestries, providing a readily available imputation approach without the need to have access to large training data sets.},

Imprinting is proposed to have evolved because it enhances evolvability in a changing environment, protects females against the ravages of invasive trophoblast, or because natural selection acts differently on genes of maternal and paternal origin in interactions among kin. The last hypothesis has received the most extensive theoretical development and seems the best supported by the properties of known imprinted genes. However, the hypothesis is yet to provide a compelling explanation for many examples of imprinting.},

Somatic (cancer-only) single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are the simplest class of mutation, yet their identification in DNA sequencing data is confounded by germline polymorphisms, tumour heterogeneity and sequencing and analysis errors. Four recently published algorithms for the detection of somatic SNV sites in matched cancer-normal sequencing datasets are VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix and Strelka. In this analysis, we apply these four SNV calling algorithms to cancer-normal Illumina exome sequencing of a chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patient. The candidate SNV sites returned by each algorithm are filtered to remove likely false positives, then characterized and compared to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each SNV calling algorithm. RESULTS Comparing the candidate SNV sets returned by VarScan, SomaticSniper, JointSNVMix2 and Strelka revealed substantial differences with respect to the number and character of sites returned; the somatic probability scores assigned to the same sites; their susceptibility to various sources of noise; and their sensitivities to low-allelic-fraction candidates.

  abstract      = {Mammalian viviparity (intrauterine development of the fetus) introduced a new dimension to brain development, with the fetal hypothalamus and fetal placenta developing at a time when the fetal placenta engages hypothalamic structures of the maternal generation. Such transgenerational interactions provide a basis for ensuring optimal maternalism in the next generation. This success has depended on genomic imprinting and a biased role of the matriline. Maternal methylation imprints determine parent of origin expression of genes fundamental to both placental and hypothalamic development. The matriline takes a further leading role for transgenerational reprogramming of these imprints. Developmental errors are minimized by the tight control that imprinted genes have on regulation of downstream evolutionary expanded gene families important for placental and hypothalamic development. Imprinted genes themselves have undergone purifying selection, providing a framework of stability for in utero development with most growth variance occurring postnatally. Mothers, not fathers, take the lead in the endocrinological and behavior adaptations that nurture, feed, and protect the infant. In utero coadaptive development of the placenta and hypothalamus has thus required a concomitant development to ensure male masculinization. Only placental male mammals evolved the sex determining SRY, which activates Sox9 for testes formation. SRY is a hybrid gene of Dgcr8 expressed in the developing placenta and Sox3 expressed in hypothalamic development. This hybridization of genes that take their origin from the placenta and hypothalamus has enabled critical in utero timing for the development of fetal Leydig cells, and hence testosterone production for hypothalamic masculinization.},

One way of getting at such an understanding is to find out which parts of our DNA, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, affect particular intermediary processes such as gene expression. Naively, such associations can be identified using a simple statistical test on all paired combinations of genetic variants and gene transcripts. However, a wide variety of confounders lie hidden in the data, leading to both spurious associations and missed associations if not properly addressed. We present a statistical model that jointly corrects for two particular kinds of hidden structure--population structure (e.g., race, family-relatedness), and microarray expression artifacts (e.g., batch effects), when these confounders are unknown. Applying our method to both real and synthetic, human and mouse data, we demonstrate the need for such a joint correction of confounders, and also the disadvantages of other possible approaches based on those in the current literature. In particular, we show that our class of models has maximum power to detect eQTL on synthetic data, and has the best performance on a bronze standard applied to real data. Lastly, our software and the associations we found with it are available at http://www.microsoft.com/science.},

RESULTS We describe a statistical and visualization framework, variancePartition, to prioritize drivers of variation based on a genome-wide summary, and identify genes that deviate from the genome-wide trend. Using a linear mixed model, variancePartition quantifies variation in each expression trait attributable to differences in disease status, sex, cell or tissue type, ancestry, genetic background, experimental stimulus, or technical variables. Analysis of four large-scale transcriptome profiling datasets illustrates that variancePartition recovers striking patterns of biological and technical variation that are reproducible across multiple datasets.

  abstract      = {Autistic-spectrum conditions and psychotic-spectrum conditions (mainly schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression) represent two major suites of disorders of human cognition, affect, and behavior that involve altered development and function of the social brain. We describe evidence that a large set of phenotypic traits exhibit diametrically opposite phenotypes in autistic-spectrum versus psychotic-spectrum conditions, with a focus on schizophrenia. This suite of traits is inter-correlated, in that autism involves a general pattern of constrained overgrowth, whereas schizophrenia involves undergrowth. These disorders also exhibit diametric patterns for traits related to social brain development, including aspects of gaze, agency, social cognition, local versus global processing, language, and behavior. Social cognition is thus underdeveloped in autistic-spectrum conditions and hyper-developed on the psychotic spectrum.;{\textgreater}We propose and evaluate a novel hypothesis that may help to explain these diametric phenotypes: that the development of these two sets of conditions is mediated in part by alterations of genomic imprinting. Evidence regarding the genetic, physiological, neurological, and psychological underpinnings of psychotic-spectrum conditions supports the hypothesis that the etiologies of these conditions involve biases towards increased relative effects from imprinted genes with maternal expression, which engender a general pattern of undergrowth. By contrast, autistic-spectrum conditions appear to involve increased relative bias towards effects of paternally expressed genes, which mediate overgrowth. This hypothesis provides a simple yet comprehensive theory, grounded in evolutionary biology and genetics, for understanding the causes and phenotypes of autistic-spectrum and psychotic-spectrum conditions.},

However, identifying interactions between the environment and an individual's genetic background (GxE) has been hampered by statistical and computational challenges. By combining RNA sequencing of whole blood and extensive environmental annotations collected from 922 individuals, we have evaluated GxE interactions at a cellular level. We have developed EAGLE, a hierarchical Bayesian model for identifying GxE interactions based on association between environment and allele-specific expression (ASE). EAGLE increases power by leveraging the controlled, within-sample comparison of environmental impact on different genetic backgrounds provided by ASE, while also taking into account technical covariates and over-dispersion of sequencing read counts. EAGLE identifies 35 GxE interactions, a substantial increase over standard GxE testing. Among EAGLE hits are variants that modulate response to smoking, exercise and blood pressure medication. Further, application of EAGLE identifies GxE interactions to infection response that replicate results reported in vitro, demonstrating the power of EAGLE to accurately identify GxE candidates from large RNA sequencing studies.},

  abstract      = {The imprinted brain theory proposes that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a paternal bias in the expression of imprinted genes. This is reflected in a preference for mechanistic cognition and in the corresponding mentalistic deficits symptomatic of ASD. Psychotic spectrum disorder (PSD) would correspondingly result from an imbalance in favor of maternal and/or X-chromosome gene expression. If differences in gene expression were reflected locally in the human brain as mouse models and other evidence suggests they are, ASD would represent not so much an 'extreme male brain' as an extreme paternal one, with PSD correspondingly representing an extreme maternal brain. To the extent that copy number variation resembles imprinting and aneuploidy in nullifying or multiplying the expression of particular genes, it has been found to conform to the diametric model of mental illness peculiar to the imprinted brain theory. The fact that nongenetic factors such as nutrition in pregnancy can mimic and/or interact with imprinted gene expression suggests that the theory might even be able to explain the notable effect of maternal starvation on the risk of PSD - not to mention the 'autism epidemic' of modern affluent societies. Finally, the theory suggests that normality represents balanced cognition, and that genius is an extraordinary extension of cognitive configuration in both mentalistic and mechanistic directions. Were it to be proven correct, the imprinted brain theory would represent one of the biggest single advances in our understanding of the mind and of mental illness that has ever taken place, and would revolutionize psychiatric diagnosis, prevention and treatment - not to mention our understanding of epigenomics.},

Evidence from the genetics and genomics of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Prader-Willi syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and other neurogenetic conditions support the hypothesis that the etiologies of psychotic spectrum conditions commonly involve genetic and epigenetic imbalances in the effects of imprinted genes, with a bias towards increased relative effects from imprinted genes with maternal expression or other genes favouring maternal interests. By contrast, autistic spectrum conditions, including Kanner autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, Turner syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, commonly engender increased relative effects from paternally expressed imprinted genes, or reduced effects from genes favouring maternal interests. Imprinted-gene effects on the etiologies of autistic and psychotic spectrum conditions parallel the diametric effects of imprinted genes in placental and foetal development, in that psychotic spectrum conditions tend to be associated with undergrowth and relatively-slow brain development, whereas some autistic spectrum conditions involve brain and body overgrowth, especially in foetal development and early childhood. An important role for imprinted genes in the etiologies of psychotic and autistic spectrum conditions is consistent with neurodevelopmental models of these disorders, and with predictions from the conflict theory of genomic imprinting.},

Random X inactivation and genomic imprinting are epigenetic allelic effects that are well known to influence genetic architecture and disease risk. Less is known about the nature, prevalence, and conservation of other potential epigenetic allelic effects in vivo in the mouse and primate brain. Here we devise genomics, in situ hybridization, and mouse genetics strategies to uncover diverse allelic effects in the brain that are not caused by imprinting or genetic variation. We found allelic effects that are developmental stage and cell type specific, that are prevalent in the neonatal brain, and that cause mosaics of monoallelic brain cells that differentially express wild-type and mutant alleles for heterozygous mutations. Finally, we show that diverse non-genetic allelic effects that impact mental illness risk genes exist in the macaque and human brain. Our findings have potential implications for mammalian brain genetics. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

RASQUAL substantially improves fine-mapping accuracy and sensitivity relative to existing methods in RNA-seq, DNase-seq and ChIP-seq data. We illustrate how RASQUAL can be used to maximize association detection by generating the first map of chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in a European population using ATAC-seq. Despite a modest sample size, we identified 2,707 independent caQTLs (at a false discovery rate of 10{\%}) and demonstrated how RASQUAL and ATAC-seq can provide powerful information for fine-mapping gene-regulatory variants and for linking distal regulatory elements with gene promoters.

Here we investigate genomic imprinting in the cerebellum using a newly developed Bayesian statistical model that provides unprecedented transcript-level resolution. We uncover 160 imprinted transcripts, including 41 novel and independently validated imprinted genes. Strikingly, many genes exhibit parentally biased--rather than monoallelic--expression, with different magnitudes according to age, organ, and brain region. Developmental changes in parental bias and overall gene expression are strongly correlated, suggesting combined roles in regulating gene dosage. Finally, brain-specific deletion of the paternal, but not maternal, allele of the paternally-biased Bcl-x, (Bcl2l1) results in loss of specific neuron types, supporting the functional significance of parental biases. These findings reveal the remarkable complexity of genomic imprinting, with important implications for understanding the normal and diseased brain.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

  abstract      = {Genomic imprinting refers to the process whereby genes are silenced when inherited via sperm or egg. The most widely accepted theory for the evolution of genomic imprinting-the kinship theory-argues that conflict between maternally inherited and paternally inherited genes over phenotypes with asymmetric effects on matrilineal and patrilineal kin results in self-imposed silencing of one of the copies. This theory was originally developed in the context of fitness interactions within nuclear families, to understand intragenomic conflict in the embryo and infant, but it has recently been extended to encompass interactions within wider social groups, to understand intragenomic conflict over the social behavior of juveniles and adults. Here, we complete our model of genomic imprinting in the social brain by considering age-specific levels of expression in a society were generations overlap, to determine how intragenomic conflict plays out in older age. We determine the role of sex bias in juvenile dispersal, reproductive success, and adult mortality in mediating the direction and intensity of conflict over the competing demands of parental and communal care as the individual ages. We discover that sex-specific asymmetries in these demographic parameters result in intragenomic conflict at early age but this conflict gradually decays with age. Although individuals are riven by internal conflict in their youth and middle age, they put their demons to rest in later life.},

  abstract      = {In contrast to existing estimates of approximately 200 murine imprinted genes, recent work based on transcriptome sequencing uncovered parent-of-origin allelic effects at more than 1,300 loci in the developing brain and two adult brain regions, including hundreds present in only males or females. Our independent replication of the embryonic brain stage, where the majority of novel imprinted genes were discovered and the majority of previously known imprinted genes confirmed, resulted in only 12.9{\%} concordance among the novel imprinted loci. Further analysis and pyrosequencing-based validation revealed that the vast majority of the novel reported imprinted loci are false-positives explained by technical and biological variation of the experimental approach. We show that allele-specific expression (ASE) measured with RNA-Seq is not accurately modeled with statistical methods that assume random independent sampling and that systematic error must be accounted for to enable accurate identification of imprinted expression. Application of a robust approach that accounts for these effects revealed 50 candidate genes where allelic bias was predicted to be parent-of-origin-dependent. However, 11 independent validation attempts through a range of allelic expression biases confirmed only 6 of these novel cases. The results emphasize the importance of independent validation and suggest that the number of imprinted genes is much closer to the initial estimates.},

  abstract      = {Inactivation of the maternally imprinted, paternally expressed gene 3 (Peg3) induces deficits in olfactory function, sexual and maternal behaviors, oxytocin neuron number, metabolic homeostasis and growth. Peg3 is expressed in a number of developing hypothalamic and basal forebrain structures and is a component of the P53 apoptosis pathway. Peg3 inactivation in neuronal cell culture lines inhibits P53 mediated apoptosis, which is important in the early postnatal development and sexual differentiation of the brain. In this study, we investigated the effect of inactivating the Peg3 gene on the incidence of caspase 3 positive cells (a marker of apoptosis) in 4- and 6-day postpartum mouse brain. Inactivating the Peg3 gene resulted in an increase in the incidence of total forebrain caspase 3 positive cells at 4 and 6 days postpartum. Increases in specific neuroanatomical regions including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, medial pre-optic area, arcuate nucleus, medial amygdala, anterior cortical and posteriodorsal amygdaloid nuclei, were also observed. In wild-type mice, sex differences in the incidence of caspase 3 positive cells in the medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, arcuate nucleus and the M2 motor cortex, were also observed. This neural sex difference was ameliorated in the Peg-3 mutant. These findings suggest that the neuronal and behavioral deficits seen in mice lacking a functional Peg3 gene are mediated by increases in the incidence of early neonatal apoptosis in neuroanatomical regions important for reproductive behavior, olfactory and pheromonal processing, thermoregulation and reward.},

We have used RNA-sequencing analysis and linear mixed models to examine the sources of gene expression variability in 317 human iPSC lines from 101 individuals. We found that ∼50{\%} of genome-wide expression variability is explained by variation across individuals and identified a set of expression quantitative trait loci that contribute to this variation. These analyses coupled with allele-specific expression show that iPSCs retain a donor-specific gene expression pattern. Network, pathway, and key driver analyses showed that Polycomb targets contribute significantly to the non-genetic variability seen within and across individuals, highlighting this chromatin regulator as a likely source of reprogramming-based variability. Our findings therefore shed light on variation between iPSC lines and illustrate the potential for our dataset and other similar large-scale analyses to identify underlying drivers relevant to iPSC applications.},

Chromosomal deletions of 1q21.1, 3q29, 15q13.3, 22q11.2, and NRXN1 and duplications of 15q11-q13 (maternal), 16p11, and 16p13.3 have the strongest association with schizophrenia. We hypothesized that cases with both schizophrenia and epilepsy would have a higher frequency of disease-associated CNVs and would represent an enriched sample for detection of other mutations associated with schizophrenia. METHODS We used array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to analyze 235 individuals with both schizophrenia and epilepsy, 80 with bipolar disorder and epilepsy, and 191 controls. RESULTS We detected 10 schizophrenia plus epilepsy cases in 235 (4.3{\%}) with the above mentioned CNVs compared to 0 in 191 controls (p = 0.003). Other likely pathological findings in schizophrenia plus epilepsy cases included 1 deletion 16p13 and 1 duplication 7q11.23 for a total of 12/235 (5.1{\%}) while a possibly pathogenic duplication of 22q11.2 was found in one control for a total of 1 in 191 (0.5{\%}) controls (p = 0.008). The rate of abnormality in the schizophrenia plus epilepsy of 10/235 for the more definite CNVs compares to a rate of 75/7336 for these same CNVs in a series of unselected schizophrenia cases (p = 0.0004). CONCLUSION We found a statistically significant increase in the frequency of CNVs known or likely to be associated with schizophrenia in individuals with both schizophrenia and epilepsy compared to controls. We found an overall 5.1{\%} detection rate of likely pathological findings which is the highest frequency of such findings in a series of schizophrenia patients to date. This evidence suggests that the frequency of disease-associated CNVs in patients with both schizophrenia and epilepsy is significantly higher than for unselected schizophrenia.},

A meta-analysis of microarray data reveals that Zac1 is a member of a network of coregulated genes comprising other imprinted genes involved in the control of embryonic growth. Zac1 alters the expression of several of these imprinted genes, including Igf2, H19, Cdkn1c, and Dlk1, and it directly regulates the Igf2/H19 locus through binding to a shared enhancer. Accordingly, these data identify a network of imprinted genes, including Zac1, which controls embryonic growth and which may be the basis for the implementation of a common mechanism of gene regulation during mammalian evolution.},

Many imprinted genes are expressed in neural systems associated with feeding and motivated behaviors, and parental biases preferentially target genetic pathways governing metabolism and cell adhesion.

  abstract      = {MOTIVATION Next-generation sequencing has become an important tool for genome-wide quantification of DNA and RNA. However, a major technical hurdle lies in the need to map short sequence reads back to their correct locations in a reference genome. Here, we investigate the impact of SNP variation on the reliability of read-mapping in the context of detecting allele-specific expression (ASE). RESULTS We generated 16 million 35 bp reads from mRNA of each of two HapMap Yoruba individuals. When we mapped these reads to the human genome we found that, at heterozygous SNPs, there was a significant bias toward higher mapping rates of the allele in the reference sequence, compared with the alternative allele. Masking known SNP positions in the genome sequence eliminated the reference bias but, surprisingly, did not lead to more reliable results overall. We find that even after masking, approximately 5-10{\%} of SNPs still have an inherent bias toward more effective mapping of one allele. Filtering out inherently biased SNPs removes 40{\%} of the top signals of ASE. The remaining SNPs showing ASE are enriched in genes previously known to harbor cis-regulatory variation or known to show uniparental imprinting. Our results have implications for a variety of applications involving detection of alternate alleles from short-read sequence data.

With the rapid adoption of genome-wide sequencing in biomedical research, HLA typing based on transcriptome and whole exome/genome sequencing data becomes increasingly attractive due to its high throughput and convenience. However, unlike targeted amplicon sequencing, genome-wide sequencing often employs a reduced read length and coverage that impose great challenges in resolving the highly homologous HLA alleles. Though several algorithms exist and have been applied to four-digit typing, some deliver low to moderate accuracies, some output ambiguous predictions. Moreover, few methods suit diverse read lengths and depths, and both RNA and DNA sequencing inputs. New algorithms are therefore needed to leverage the accuracy and flexibility of HLA typing at high resolution using genome-wide sequencing data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We have developed a new algorithm named PHLAT to discover the most probable pair of HLA alleles at four-digit resolution or higher, via a unique integration of a candidate allele selection and a likelihood scoring. Over a comprehensive set of benchmarking data (a total of 768 HLA alleles) from both RNA and DNA sequencing and with a broad range of read lengths and coverage, PHLAT consistently achieves a high accuracy at four-digit (92{\%}-95{\%}) and two-digit resolutions (96{\%}-99{\%}), outcompeting most of the existing methods. It also supports targeted amplicon sequencing data from Illumina Miseq.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: PHLAT significantly leverages the accuracy and flexibility of high resolution HLA typing based on genome-wide sequencing data. It may benefit both basic and applied research in immunology and related fields as well as numerous clinical applications.},

Here, I focus on a few recent developments in the field of monoallelic expression that are of particular interest and raise interesting questions for future work. One development is regarding analyses of imprinted genes, in which recent work suggests the possibility that intriguing networks of imprinted genes exist and are important for genetic and physiological studies. Another issue that has been raised in recent years by a number of publications is the question of how skewed allelic expression should be for it to be designated as monoallelic expression and, further, what methods are appropriate or inappropriate for analyzing genomic data to examine allele-specific expression. Perhaps the most exciting recent development in mammalian monoallelic expression is a clever and carefully executed analysis of genetic diversity of autosomal genes subject to random monoallelic expression (RMAE), which provides compelling evidence for distinct evolutionary forces acting on random monoallelically expressed genes.},

  abstract      = {OBJECTIVE Rare copy number variants have been implicated in different neurodevelopmental disorders, with the same copy number variants often increasing risk of more than one of these phenotypes. In a discovery sample of 22 schizophrenia patients with an early onset of illness (10-15 years of age), the authors observed in one patient a maternally derived 15q11-q13 duplication overlapping the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region. This prompted investigation of the role of 15q11-q13 duplications in psychotic illness. METHOD The authors scanned 7,582 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 41,370 comparison subjects without known psychiatric illness for copy number variants at 15q11-q13 and determined the parental origin of duplications using methylation-sensitive Southern hybridization analysis. RESULTS Duplications were found in four case patients and five comparison subjects. All four case patients had maternally derived duplications (0.05{\%}), while only three of the five comparison duplications were maternally derived (0.007{\%}), resulting in a significant excess of maternally derived duplications in case patients (odds ratio=7.3). This excess is compatible with earlier observations that risk for psychosis in people with Prader-Willi syndrome caused by maternal uniparental disomy is much higher than in those caused by deletion of the paternal chromosome. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the presence of two maternal copies of a fragment of chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1 that overlaps with the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region may be a rare risk factor for schizophrenia and other psychoses. Given that maternal duplications of this region are among the most consistent cytogenetic observations in autism, the findings provide further support for a shared genetic etiology between autism and psychosis.},

Here, we present Pascal (Pathway scoring algorithm), a powerful tool for computing gene and pathway scores from SNP-phenotype association summary statistics. For gene score computation, we implemented analytic and efficient numerical solutions to calculate test statistics. We examined in particular the sum and the maximum of chi-squared statistics, which measure the strongest and the average association signals per gene, respectively. For pathway scoring, we use a modified Fisher method, which offers not only significant power improvement over more traditional enrichment strategies, but also eliminates the problem of arbitrary threshold selection inherent in any binary membership based pathway enrichment approach. We demonstrate the marked increase in power by analyzing summary statistics from dozens of large meta-studies for various traits. Our extensive testing indicates that our method not only excels in rigorous type I error control, but also results in more biologically meaningful discoveries.},

Such factors, including varying gene size and single-nucleotide polymorphism density, linkage disequilibrium within and between genes and overlapping genes with similar annotations, are often not accounted for by existing gene-set enrichment methods. By using a genomic permutation procedure, we generate experiment-wide empirical significance values, corrected for the total number of sets tested, implicitly taking overlap of sets into account.

Many current methods are based on algorithms that consider pathways as simple gene lists, dramatically under-utilizing the knowledge that such pathways are meant to capture.

These topology-based methods, sometimes referred to as "third generation," have the potential to better model the phenomena described by pathways. Although there is now a large variety of approaches used for this purpose, no review is currently available to offer guidance for potential users and developers. This review covers 22 such topology-based pathway analysis methods published in the last decade. We compare these methods based on: type of pathways analyzed (e.g., signaling or metabolic), input (subset of genes, all genes, fold changes, gene p-values, etc.), mathematical models, pathway scoring approaches, output (one or more pathway scores, p-values, etc.) and implementation (web-based, standalone, etc.). We identify and discuss challenges, arising both in methodology and in pathway representation, including inconsistent terminology, different data formats, lack of meaningful benchmarks, and the lack of tissue and condition specificity.},

Because of the importance of this type of analysis, more than 70 pathway analysis methods have been proposed so far. These can be categorized into two main categories: non-topology-based (non-TB) and topology-based (TB). Although some review papers discuss this topic from different aspects, there is no systematic, large-scale assessment of such methods. Furthermore, the majority of the pathway analysis approaches rely on the assumption of uniformity of p values under the null hypothesis, which is often not true. This article presents the most comprehensive comparative study on pathway analysis methods available to date. We compare the actual performance of 13 widely used pathway analysis methods in over 1085 analyses. These comparisons were performed using 2601 samples from 75 human disease data sets and 121 samples from 11 knockout mouse data sets. In addition, we investigate the extent to which each method is biased under the null hypothesis. Together, these data and results constitute a reliable benchmark against which future pathway analysis methods could and should be tested. Overall, the result shows that no method is perfect. In general, TB methods appear to perform better than non-TB methods. This is somewhat expected since the TB methods take into consideration the structure of the pathway which is meant to describe the underlying phenomena. We also discover that most, if not all, listed approaches are biased and can produce skewed results under the null.},

  abstract        = {Thousands of disease-associated SNPs (daSNPs) are located in intergenic regions (IGR), making it difficult to understand their association with disease phenotypes. Recent analysis found that non-coding daSNPs were frequently located in or approximate to regulatory elements, inspiring us to try to explain the disease phenotypes of IGR daSNPs through nearby regulatory sequences. Hence, after locating the nearest distal regulatory element (DRE) to a given IGR daSNP, we applied a computational method named INTREPID to predict the target genes regulated by the DRE, and then investigated their functional relevance to the IGR daSNP's disease phenotypes. 36.8% of all IGR daSNP-disease phenotype associations investigated were possibly explainable through the predicted target genes, which were enriched with, were functionally relevant to, or consisted of the corresponding disease genes. This proportion could be further increased to 60.5% if the LD SNPs of daSNPs were also considered. Furthermore, the predicted SNP-target gene pairs were enriched with known eQTL/mQTL SNP-gene relationships. Overall, it's likely that IGR daSNPs may contribute to disease phenotypes by interfering with the regulatory function of their nearby DREs and causing abnormal expression of disease genes.},

We integrate chromatin conformation capture data (HiC) with literature support to rank putative target genes of intergenic disease-associated SNPs. We demonstrate that this hybrid method outperforms a genomic distance baseline on a small test set of expression quantitative trait loci, as well as either method individually. In addition, we show the potential for this method to uncover relationships between intergenic SNPs and target genes across chromosomes. With more extensive chromatin conformation capture data becoming readily available, this method provides a way forward towards functional interpretation of SNPs in the context of the three dimensional structure of the genome in the nucleus.},

Early findings, however, revealed a more complex genetic architecture than was anticipated for most common diseases - complexity that seemed to limit the immediate utility of these findings. As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information. Nevertheless, recent efforts have begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify groups of individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease. In this context, we review the evidence supporting the personal and clinical utility of polygenic risk profiling.},

Tumour sequencing studies have characterised somatic mutation profiles in breast cancer patients. The relationship between breast cancer susceptibility loci and somatic mutation patterns in breast cancer remains largely unexplored. We used single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array data and tumour exome sequencing data available from 638 breast cancer patients of European ancestry from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We analysed both genotype data and, when necessary, imputed genotypes for 90 known breast cancer susceptibility loci. We performed linear regression models to investigate possible associations between germline risk variants with total somatic mutation count (TSMC), as well as specific mutation types. We examined individual SNP genotypes, as well as a multi-SNP polygenic risk score (PRS). Models were statistically adjusted for age at diagnosis, stage, oestrogen-receptor (ER) and progesterone-receptor (PR) status of breast cancer. We also performed stratified analyses by ER and PR status. We observed a significant inverse association (P=8.75 × 10(-6); FDR=0.001) between the risk allele in rs2588809 of the gene RAD51B and TSMC across all breast cancer patients, for both ER(+) and ER(-) tumours. This association was also evident for different types of mutations. The PRS analysis for all patients, with or without rs2588809, showed a significant inverse association (P=0.01 and 0.04, respectively) with TSMC. This inverse association was significant in ER(+) patients with the ER(+)-specific PRS (P=0.02), but not among ER(-) patients for the ER(-)-specific PRS (P=0.39). We observed an inverse association between common germline risk variants and TSMC, which, if confirmed, could provide new insights into how germline variation informs our understanding of somatic mutation patterns in breast cancer.},

These two approaches make very different assumptions, so are expected to perform well in different situations. However, in practice, for a given dataset one typically does not know which assumptions will be more accurate. Motivated by this, we consider a hybrid of the two, which we refer to as a "Bayesian sparse linear mixed model" (BSLMM) that includes both these models as special cases. We address several key computational and statistical issues that arise when applying BSLMM, including appropriate prior specification for the hyper-parameters and a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference. We apply BSLMM and compare it with other methods for two polygenic modeling applications: estimating the proportion of variance in phenotypes explained (PVE) by available genotypes, and phenotype (or breeding value) prediction. For PVE estimation, we demonstrate that BSLMM combines the advantages of both standard LMMs and sparse regression modeling. For phenotype prediction it considerably outperforms either of the other two methods, as well as several other large-scale regression methods previously suggested for this problem. Software implementing our method is freely available from http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu/software.html.},

The model naturally incorporates multiple types of annotations. I applied the model to GWASs of 18 human traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels, height, body mass index, and Crohn disease. For each trait, I used the model to evaluate the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over 100 tissues and cell lines. The fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs influencing protein sequence ranged from around 2% (for platelet volume) up to around 20% (for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), repressed chromatin was significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several traits, and cell-type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites were enriched with SNPs associated with several traits (for example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, reweighting each GWAS by using information from functional genomics increased the number of loci with high-confidence associations by around 5%.},

However, for polygenic traits, such as psychiatric disorders, the accuracy of risk prediction is low. Here we use a multivariate linear mixed model and apply multi-trait genomic best linear unbiased prediction for genetic risk prediction. This method exploits correlations between disorders and simultaneously evaluates individual risk for each disorder. We show that the multivariate approach significantly increases the prediction accuracy for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder in the discovery as well as in independent validation datasets. By grouping SNPs based on genome annotation and fitting multiple random effects, we show that the prediction accuracy could be further improved. The gain in prediction accuracy of the multivariate approach is equivalent to an increase in sample size of 34% for schizophrenia, 68% for bipolar disorder, and 76% for major depressive disorders using single trait models. Because our approach can be readily applied to any number of GWAS datasets of correlated traits, it is a flexible and powerful tool to maximize prediction accuracy. With current sample size, risk predictors are not useful in a clinical setting but already are a valuable research tool, for example in experimental designs comparing cases with high and low polygenic risk.},

  abstract        = {Polygenic scores have recently been used to summarise genetic effects among an ensemble of markers that do not individually achieve significance in a large-scale association study. Markers are selected using an initial training sample and used to construct a score in an independent replication sample by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles within each subject. Association between a trait and this composite score implies that a genetic signal is present among the selected markers, and the score can then be used for prediction of individual trait values. This approach has been used to obtain evidence of a genetic effect when no single markers are significant, to establish a common genetic basis for related disorders, and to construct risk prediction models. In some cases, however, the desired association or prediction has not been achieved. Here, the power and predictive accuracy of a polygenic score are derived from a quantitative genetics model as a function of the sizes of the two samples, explained genetic variance, selection thresholds for including a marker in the score, and methods for weighting effect sizes in the score. Expressions are derived for quantitative and discrete traits, the latter allowing for case/control sampling. A novel approach to estimating the variance explained by a marker panel is also proposed. It is shown that published studies with significant association of polygenic scores have been well powered, whereas those with negative results can be explained by low sample size. It is also shown that useful levels of prediction may only be approached when predictors are estimated from very large samples, up to an order of magnitude greater than currently available. Therefore, polygenic scores currently have more utility for association testing than predicting complex traits, but prediction will become more feasible as sample sizes continue to grow.},

  abstract        = {Empirical studies suggest that the effect sizes of individual causal risk alleles underlying complex genetic diseases are small, with most genotype relative risks in the range of 1.1-2.0. Although the increased risk of disease for a carrier is small for any single locus, knowledge of multiple-risk alleles throughout the genome could allow the identification of individuals that are at high risk. In this study, we investigate the number and effect size of risk loci that underlie complex disease constrained by the disease parameters of prevalence and heritability. Then we quantify the value of prediction of genetic risk to disease using a range of realistic combinations of the number, size, and distribution of risk effects that underlie complex diseases. We propose an approach to assess the genetic risk of a disease in healthy individuals, based on dense genome-wide SNP panels. We test this approach using simulation. When the number of loci contributing to the disease is >50, a large case-control study is needed to identify a set of risk loci for use in predicting the disease risk of healthy people not included in the case-control study. For diseases controlled by 1000 loci of mean relative risk of only 1.04, a case-control study with 10,000 cases and controls can lead to selection of approximately 75 loci that explain >50% of the genetic variance. The 5% of people with the highest predicted risk are three to seven times more likely to suffer the disease than the population average, depending on heritability and disease prevalence. Whether an individual with known genetic risk develops the disease depends on known and unknown environmental factors.},

Findings can be investigated using a web application (http:‌//‌mrcieu.‌mrsoftware.org/‌PRS‌_atlas/), which we envisage will help uncover both known and novel mechanisms which contribute towards disease susceptibility. To demonstrate this, we have investigated the results from a phenome-wide evaluation of schizophrenia genetic liability. Amongst findings were inverse associations with measures of cognitive function which extensive follow-up analyses using Mendelian randomization (MR) provided evidence of a causal relationship. We have also investigated the effect of multiple risk factors on disease using mediation and multivariable MR frameworks. Our atlas provides a resource for future endeavours seeking to unravel the causal determinants of complex disease.},

  abstract        = {Individuals at high risk for schizophrenia may benefit from early intervention, but few validated risk predictors are available. Genetic profiling is one approach to risk stratification that has been extensively validated in research cohorts. The authors sought to test the utility of this approach in clinical settings and to evaluate the broader health consequences of high genetic risk for schizophrenia. The authors used electronic health records for 106,160 patients from four health care systems to evaluate the penetrance and pleiotropy of genetic risk for schizophrenia. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia were calculated from summary statistics and tested for association with 1,359 disease categories, including schizophrenia and psychosis, in phenome-wide association studies. Effects were combined through meta-analysis across sites. PRSs were robustly associated with schizophrenia (odds ratio per standard deviation increase in PRS, 1.55; 95% CI=1.4, 1.7), and patients in the highest risk decile of the PRS distribution had up to 4.6-fold higher odds of schizophrenia compared with those in the bottom decile (95% CI=2.9, 7.3). PRSs were also positively associated with other phenotypes, including anxiety, mood, substance use, neurological, and personality disorders, as well as suicidal behavior, memory loss, and urinary syndromes; they were inversely related to obesity. The study demonstrates that an available measure of genetic risk for schizophrenia is robustly associated with schizophrenia in health care settings and has pleiotropic effects on related psychiatric disorders as well as other medical syndromes. The results provide an initial indication of the opportunities and limitations that may arise with the future application of PRS testing in health care systems.},

We report a new genome-wide association study of schizophrenia (11,260 cases and 24,542 controls), and through meta-analysis with existing data we identify 50 novel associated loci and 145 loci in total. Through integrating genomic fine-mapping with brain expression and chromosome conformation data, we identify candidate causal genes within 33 loci. We also show for the first time that the common variant association signal is highly enriched among genes that are under strong selective pressures. These findings provide new insights into the biology and genetic architecture of schizophrenia, highlight the importance of mutation-intolerant genes and suggest a mechanism by which common risk variants persist in the population.},

  abstract        = {Disorders of the brain can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 brain disorders from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. Psychiatric disorders share common variant risk, whereas neurological disorders appear more distinct from one another and from the psychiatric disorders. We also identified significant sharing between disorders and a number of brain phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for brain disorders and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.},

  abstract        = {Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder with a lifetime risk of about 1%, characterized by hallucinations, delusions and cognitive deficits, with heritability estimated at up to 80%. We performed a genome-wide association study of 3,322 European individuals with schizophrenia and 3,587 controls. Here we show, using two analytic approaches, the extent to which common genetic variation underlies the risk of schizophrenia. First, we implicate the major histocompatibility complex. Second, we provide molecular genetic evidence for a substantial polygenic component to the risk of schizophrenia involving thousands of common alleles of very small effect. We show that this component also contributes to the risk of bipolar disorder, but not to several non-psychiatric diseases.},

  abstract     = {Polygenic [risk] scores (PGS) can enhance prediction and understanding of common diseases and traits. However, the reproducibility of PGS and their subsequent applications in biological and clinical research have been hindered by several factors, including: inadequate and incomplete reporting of PGS development, heterogeneity in evaluation techniques, and inconsistent access to, and distribution of, the information necessary to calculate the scores themselves. To address this we present the PGS Catalog (www.PGSCatalog.org), an open resource for polygenic scores. The PGS Catalog currently contains 192 published PGS from 78 publications for 86 diverse traits, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, cancers, as well as traits like BMI and blood lipids. Each PGS is annotated with metadata required for reproducibility as well as accurate application in independent studies. Using the PGS Catalog, we demonstrate that multiple PGS can be systematically evaluated to generate comparable performance metrics. The PGS Catalog has capabilities for user deposition, expert curation and programmatic access, thus providing the community with an open platform for polygenic score research and translation.Competing Interest StatementJohn Danesh sits on the International Cardiovascular and Metabolic Advisory Board for Novartis (since 2010); the Steering Committee of UK Biobank (since 2011); the MRC International Advisory Group (ING) member, London (since 2013); the MRC High Throughput Science Omics Panel Member, London (since 2013); the Scientific Advisory Committee for Sanofi (since 2013); the International Cardiovascular and Metabolism Research and Development Portfolio Committee for Novartis; and the Astra Zeneca Genomics Advisory Board (2018).Funding StatementThis work was supported by core funding from: the UK Medical Research Council (MR/L003120/1), the British Heart Foundation (RG/13/13/30194;RG/18/13/33946) and the National Institute for Health Research [Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre at the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust] [*].

  abstract     = {The application of polygenic risk scores (PRS) has become routine across genetic research. Among a range of applications, PRS are exploited to assess shared aetiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the predictive power of genetic data for use in clinical settings, and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed on individuals, or their biological samples (eg. tissues, cells), at the tails of the PRS distribution and contrasted. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRS become more powerful, they are set to play a key role in personalised medicine. However, despite the growing application and importance of PRS, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here we provide detailed guidelines for performing polygenic risk score analyses relevant to different methods for their calculation, outlining standard quality control steps and offering recommendations for best-practice. We also discuss different methods for the calculation of PRS, common misconceptions regarding the interpretation of results and future challenges.},

  journal      = {medRxiv},
  year         = {2020},
  abstract     = {Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variation associated with a wide range of human diseases and traits. These findings are now commonly aggregated into polygenic risk scores, which can bridge the gap between the initial discovery efforts and clinical applications for disease risk estimation. However, there is remarkable heterogeneity in the reporting of these risk scores due to a lack of accepted standards for the development, reporting, and application of PRS. This lack of rigorous standards hinders the translation of PRS into clinical care. The ClinGen Complex Disease Working Group, in a collaboration with the Polygenic Score (PGS) Catalog, have developed a novel PRS Reporting Statement (PRS-RS), updating previous standards to the current state of the field. Drawing upon experts in epidemiology, statistics, disease-specific applications, implementation, and policy, this 33-item reporting framework defines the minimal information needed to interpret and evaluate a PRS, especially with respect to any downstream clinical applications. Items span detailed descriptions of the study population (recruitment method, key demographics, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and phenotype definition), statistical methods for both PRS development and validation, and considerations for potential limitations of the published risk score and downstream clinical utility. Additionally, emphasis has been placed on data availability and transparency to facilitate reproducibility and benchmarking against other PRS, such as deposition in the publicly available PGS Catalog. By providing these criteria in a structured format that borrows from existing standards and ontologies, the use of this framework in publishing PRS will facilitate PRS translation into clinical care and progress towards defining best practices.Competing Interest StatementMIM is on the advisory panels Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, and Zoe Global; Honoraria: Merck, Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, and Eli Lilly; Research funding: Abbvie, Astra Zeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Janssen, Merck, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche, Sanofi Aventis, Servier \&amp; Takeda.

We identify 132 risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that disrupt transcription factor binding and we find that 97 of the 132 TF binding-disrupting SNPs are associated with gene expression in human brain tissues. We validate the regulatory effect of some TF binding-disrupting SNPs with reporter gene assays (9 SNPs) and allele-specific expression analysis (10 SNPs). Our study reveals gene regulatory mechanisms affected by schizophrenia risk SNPs (including widespread disruption of POLR2A and CTCF binding) and identifies target genes for mechanistic studies and drug development. Our results can be accessed and visualized at SZDB database ( http://www.szdb.org/ ).},

  abstract        = {During the past decade, genetic studies of schizophrenia have become one of the most exciting and fast-moving areas. Hundreds of genes implicated in schizophrenia have been identified by genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression studies. However, how to systematically and efficiently use these published data to pinpoint the causal genes becomes a major challenge in schizophrenia research. Here, we release an updated version of a comprehensive database for schizophrenia research, SZDB2.0 (www.szdb.org), which accompanies significant data expansion and feature improvements, as well as functionality optimization. Compared with the first version (SZDB), the current database has the following updates: (1) We added the newly published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia from CLOZUK + PGC, which is the largest GWAS for schizophrenia; (2) We included a polygenic risk score calculator; (3) In the refined "Gene" module of SZDB2.0, we collated genetic, gene expression, methylation, and integrative results of all available schizophrenia studies; (4) In the "CNV (copy number variation)" module, we collated the results of all 77 CNV publications about schizophrenia; (5) We also updated other data, including gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), transcript QTL, methylation QTL, and protein-protein interaction data, based on the information from the latest literatures. We optimized the query interface of SZDB2.0 for a better visualization and data retrieval. The updated SZDB2.0 will advance the research of schizophrenia.},

PRS-CS utilizes a high-dimensional Bayesian regression framework, and is distinct from previous work by placing a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on SNP effect sizes, which is robust to varying genetic architectures, provides substantial computational advantages, and enables multivariate modeling of local LD patterns. Simulation studies using data from the UK Biobank show that PRS-CS outperforms existing methods across a wide range of genetic architectures, especially when the training sample size is large. We apply PRS-CS to predict six common complex diseases and six quantitative traits in the Partners HealthCare Biobank, and further demonstrate the improvement of PRS-CS in prediction accuracy over alternative methods.},

Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required. Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software program for automating and simplifying PRS analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models, and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative PRS software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power. PRSice-2's combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated, e.g., when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene set-based analyses. PRSice-2 is written in C++, with an R script for plotting, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info.},

A global enrichment of CNV burden was observed in cases (odds ratio (OR) = 1.11, P = 5.7 × 10 ), which persisted after excluding loci implicated in previous studies (OR = 1.07, P = 1.7 × 10 ). CNV burden was enriched for genes associated with synaptic function (OR = 1.68, P = 2.8 × 10 ) and neurobehavioral phenotypes in mouse (OR = 1.18, P = 7.3 × 10 ). Genome-wide significant evidence was obtained for eight loci, including 1q21.1, 2p16.3 (NRXN1), 3q29, 7q11.2, 15q13.3, distal 16p11.2, proximal 16p11.2 and 22q11.2.

  abstract        = {Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed a large number of links between genome variation and complex disease. Among other benefits, it is expected that these insights will lead to new therapeutic strategies, particularly the identification of new drug targets. In this paper, we evaluate the power of GWAS studies to find drug targets by examining how many existing drug targets have been directly 'rediscovered' by this technique, and the extent to which GWAS results may be leveraged by network information to discover known and new drug targets. We find that only a very small fraction of drug targets are directly detected in the relevant GWAS studies. We investigate two possible explanations for this observation. First, we find evidence of negative selection acting on drug target genes as a consequence of strong coupling with the disease phenotype, so reducing the incidence of SNPs linked to the disease. Second, we find that GWAS genes are substantially longer on average than drug targets and than all genes, suggesting there is a length related bias in GWAS results. In spite of the low direct relationship between drug targets and GWAS reported genes, we found these two sets of genes are closely coupled in the human protein network. As a consequence, machine-learning methods are able to recover known drug targets based on network context and the set of GWAS reported genes for the same disease. We show the approach is potentially useful for identifying drug repurposing opportunities. Although GWA studies do not directly identify most existing drug targets, there are several reasons to expect that new targets will nevertheless be discovered using these data. Initial results on drug repurposing studies using network analysis are encouraging and suggest directions for future development.},

Numerous computational approaches to drug repositioning have been developed, but methods utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWASs) data are less explored. The past decade has observed a massive growth in the amount of data from GWAS; the rich information contained in GWAS has great potential to guide drug repositioning or discovery. While multiple tools are available for finding the most relevant genes from GWAS hits, searching for top susceptibility genes is only one way to guide repositioning, which has its own limitations. Here we provide a comprehensive review of different computational approaches that employ GWAS data to guide drug repositioning. These methods include selecting top candidate genes from GWAS as drug targets, deducing drug candidates based on drug-drug and disease-disease similarities, searching for reversed expression profiles between drugs and diseases, pathway-based methods as well as approaches based on analysis of biological networks. Each method is illustrated with examples, and their respective strengths and limitations are discussed. We also discussed several areas for future research.},

Already, deep learning models can predict, with varying degrees of success, how genetic variation alters cellular processes involved in pathogenesis, which small molecules will modulate the activity of therapeutically relevant proteins, and whether radiographic images are indicative of disease. However, the flexibility of deep learning creates new challenges in guaranteeing the performance of deployed systems and in establishing trust with stakeholders, clinicians and regulators, who require a rationale for decision making. We argue that these challenges will be overcome using the same flexibility that created them; for example, by training deep models so that they can output a rationale for their predictions. Significant research in this direction will be needed to realize the full potential of deep learning in biomedicine.},

Defining the genetic architecture of a complex trait or disease is central to the scientific and clinical goals of human genetics, which are to understand disease aetiology and aid in disease screening, diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Recent technological advances have enabled genome-wide association studies and emerging next-generation sequencing studies to begin to decipher the nature of the heritable contribution to traits and disease.

Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome-including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an "omnigenic" model.},

In this review, we consider how this knowledge may translate into advances that will improve patient care.

Meta-analysis of copy number variants (CNVs) in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) dataset has confirmed that some variants have a moderate or large impact on risk, although these are rare in the population. Genome sequencing advances allow a much more comprehensive evaluation of genomic variation. We describe the key findings from whole exome studies to date. These studies are happening against a backdrop of growing understanding of the regulation and expression of genes and better functional tools to investigate molecular mechanisms in model systems. We provide an overview of how recent approaches in schizophrenia genetics are converging and consider how they could impact on diagnostics, the development of personalized medicine, and drug discovery.},

The mean lifetime prevalence of the disorder is just below 1%, but large regional differences in prevalence rates are evident owing to disparities in urbanicity and patterns of immigration. Although gross brain pathology is not a characteristic of schizophrenia, the disorder involves subtle pathological changes in specific neural cell populations and in cell-cell communication. Schizophrenia, as a cognitive and behavioural disorder, is ultimately about how the brain processes information. Indeed, neuroimaging studies have shown that information processing is functionally abnormal in patients with first-episode and chronic schizophrenia. Although pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia can relieve psychotic symptoms, such drugs generally do not lead to substantial improvements in social, cognitive and occupational functioning. Psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, cognitive remediation and supported education and employment have added treatment value, but are inconsistently applied. Given that schizophrenia starts many years before a diagnosis is typically made, the identification of individuals at risk and those in the early phases of the disorder, and the exploration of preventive approaches are crucial.},

  abstract        = {Schizophrenia is a highly polygenic disorder with important contributions from both common and rare risk alleles. We analyzed exome sequencing data for de novo variants (DNVs) in a new sample of 613 schizophrenia trios and combined this with published data to give a total of 3,444 trios. In this new data, loss-of-function (LoF) DNVs were significantly enriched among 3,471 LoF-intolerant genes, which supports previous findings. In the full dataset, genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (n = 159) were significantly enriched for LoF DNVs. Within these neurodevelopmental disorder genes, SLC6A1, which encodes a γ-aminobutyric acid transporter, was associated with missense-damaging DNVs. In 1,122 trios for which genome-wide common variant data were available, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder polygenic risk were significantly overtransmitted to probands. Probands carrying LoF or deletion DNVs in LoF-intolerant or neurodevelopmental disorder genes had significantly less overtransmission of schizophrenia polygenic risk than did non-carriers, which provides a second robust line of evidence that these DNVs increase liability to schizophrenia.},

The following article reunites some genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors of schizophrenia from revered and vast studies in a chronological and progressive fashion. Twin studies set the basics of heritability and a particular study by Davis and Phelps considers the widely ignored influence of prenatal environment in the development of schizophrenia. Mostly ignited by linkage studies, candidate gene studies explore further by fine-mapping the hypothesized variants [mostly in the forms single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and less but with greater impact copy number variations (CNVs)] associated with the disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) increase considerably the sample sizes and thus the validity of the results, while the next-generation sequencing (NGS) attain the highest yet unreplicated level of validity results.},

Here we have sequenced the exomes of 4,293 families containing individuals with developmental disorders, and meta-analysed these data with data from another 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most important factors influencing the diagnostic yield of DNMs are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents, whether close relatives are affected and the parental ages. We identified 94 genes enriched in damaging DNMs, including 14 that previously lacked compelling evidence of involvement in developmental disorders. We have also characterized the phenotypic diversity among these disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs in coding sequences; approximately half of these DNMs disrupt gene function and the remainder result in altered protein function. We estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 births, depending on parental age. Given current global demographics, this equates to almost 400,000 children born per year.},

In patients with schizophrenia who also have intellectual disability, this burden is concentrated in risk genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. After excluding known risk genes for neurodevelopmental disorders, a significant rare variant burden persists in other genes intolerant of loss-of-function variants; although this effect is notably stronger in patients with both schizophrenia and intellectual disability, it is also seen in patients with schizophrenia who do not have intellectual disability. Together, our results show that rare, damaging variants contribute to the risk of schizophrenia both with and without intellectual disability and support an overlap of genetic risk between schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  abstract        = {Both rare copy number variants (CNVs) and common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute to liability to schizophrenia, but their etiological relationship has not been fully elucidated. The authors evaluated an additive model whereby risk of schizophrenia requires less contribution from common SNPs in the presence of a rare CNV, and tested for interactions. Genetic data from 21,094 case subjects with schizophrenia and 20,227 control subjects from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were examined. Three classes of rare CNVs were assessed: CNVs previously associated with schizophrenia, CNVs with large deletions ≥500 kb, and total CNV burden. The mean polygenic risk scores (PRSs) between study subjects with and without rare CNVs were compared, and joint effects of PRS and CNVs on schizophrenia liability were modeled by using logistic regression. Schizophrenia case subjects carrying risk CNVs had a lower polygenic risk than case subjects without risk CNVs but a higher risk than control subjects. For case subjects carrying known risk CNVs, the PRS was diminished in proportion to the effect size of the CNV. The strongly associated 22q11.2 deletion required little added PRS to produce schizophrenia. Large deletions and increased CNV burden were also associated with lower polygenic risk in schizophrenia case subjects but not in control subjects or after removal of known risk CNV carriers. The authors found evidence for interactive effects of PRS and previously associated CNVs for risk for schizophrenia, and the results for large deletions and total CNV burden support an additive model. These findings offer insights into the genetic architecture of schizophrenia by illuminating how different established genetic risk factors act and interact to influence liability to schizophrenia.},

  abstract        = {Genetic variants that inactivate protein-coding genes are a powerful source of information about the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption: genes that are crucial for the function of an organism will be depleted of such variants in natural populations, whereas non-essential genes will tolerate their accumulation. However, predicted loss-of-function variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes . Here we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence predicted loss-of-function variants in this cohort after filtering for artefacts caused by sequencing and annotation errors. Using an improved model of human mutation rates, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum that represents tolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve the power of gene discovery for both common and rare diseases.},

A software pipeline, Flexible Algorithm for Novel Gene set Simulation (FANGS) develops simulated data based on a prostate cancer dataset where the KRAS and TGF-β pathways were differentially expressed. The FANGS software is compatible with other datasets and pathways. Comparisons of gene set analysis methods are presented for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Significance Analysis of Function and Expression (SAFE), sigPathway, and Correlation Adjusted Mean RAnk (CAMERA) methods. All gene set analysis methods are tested using gene sets from the MSigDB knowledge base. The false positive rate and power are estimated and presented for comparison. Recommendations are made for the utility of the default settings of methods and each method's sensitivity towards various effect sizes. The results of this study provide empirical guidance to users of gene set analysis methods. The FANGS software is available for researchers for continued methods comparisons.},

Groups of genes may be any size from a single gene to all genes on the chip (e.g. known pathways, specific areas of the genome or clusters from a cluster analysis). RESULT: The test allows groups of genes of different size to be compared, because the test gives one p-value for the group, not a p-value for each gene. Researchers can use the test to investigate hypotheses based on theory or past research or to mine gene ontology databases for interesting pathways. Multiple testing problems do not occur unless many groups are tested. Special attention is given to visualizations of the test result, focussing on the associations between samples and showing the impact of individual genes on the test result.

Correspondingly, a large number of statistical approaches for detecting gene set enrichment have been proposed, but both the interrelations and the relative performance of the various methods are still very much unclear. RESULTS: We conduct an extensive survey of statistical approaches for gene set analysis and identify a common modular structure underlying most published methods. Based on this finding we propose a general framework for detecting gene set enrichment. This framework provides a meta-theory of gene set analysis that not only helps to gain a better understanding of the relative merits of each embedded approach but also facilitates a principled comparison and offers insights into the relative interplay of the methods. CONCLUSION: We use this framework to conduct a computer simulation comparing 261 different variants of gene set enrichment procedures and to analyze two experimental data sets. Based on the results we offer recommendations for best practices regarding the choice of effective procedures for gene set enrichment analysis.},

We implement CADD as a support vector machine trained to differentiate 14.7 million high-frequency human-derived alleles from 14.7 million simulated variants. We precompute C scores for all 8.6 billion possible human single-nucleotide variants and enable scoring of short insertions-deletions. C scores correlate with allelic diversity, annotations of functionality, pathogenicity, disease severity, experimentally measured regulatory effects and complex trait associations, and they highly rank known pathogenic variants within individual genomes. The ability of CADD to prioritize functional, deleterious and pathogenic variants across many functional categories, effect sizes and genetic architectures is unmatched by any current single-annotation method.},

  abstract           = {MOTIVATION: Gene set enrichment analysis has been shown to be effective in identifying relevant biological pathways underlying complex diseases. Existing approaches lack the ability to quantify the enrichment levels accurately, hence preventing the enrichment information to be further utilized in both upstream and downstream analyses. A modernized and rigorous approach for gene set enrichment analysis that emphasizes both hypothesis testing and enrichment estimation is much needed. RESULTS: We propose a novel computational method, Bayesian Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment (BAGSE), for gene set enrichment analysis. BAGSE is built on a Bayesian hierarchical model and fully accounts for the uncertainty embedded in the association evidence of individual genes. We adopt an empirical Bayes inference framework to fit the proposed hierarchical model by implementing an efficient EM algorithm. Through simulation studies, we illustrate that BAGSE yields accurate enrichment quantification while achieving similar power as the state-of-the-art methods. Further simulation studies show that BAGSE can effectively utilize the enrichment information to improve the power in gene discovery. Finally, we demonstrate the application of BAGSE in analyzing real data from a differential expression experiment and a transcriptome-wide association study. Our results indicate that the proposed statistical framework is effective in aiding the discovery of potentially causal pathways and gene networks. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BAGSE is implemented using the C++ programing language and is freely available from https://github.com/xqwen/bagse/. Simulated and real data used in this paper are also available at the Github repository for reproducibility purposes.

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of assessing associations between multiple related outcome variables, and a single explanatory variable of interest. This problem arises in many settings, including genetic association studies, where the explanatory variable is genotype at a genetic variant. We outline a framework for conducting this type of analysis, based on Bayesian model comparison and model averaging for multivariate regressions. This framework unifies several common approaches to this problem, and includes both standard univariate and standard multivariate association tests as special cases. The framework also unifies the problems of testing for associations and explaining associations – that is, identifying which outcome variables are associated with genotype. This provides an alternative to the usual, but conceptually unsatisfying, approach of resorting to univariate tests when explaining and interpreting significant multivariate findings. The method is computationally tractable genome-wide for modest numbers of phenotypes (e.g. 5–10), and can be applied to summary data, without access to raw genotype and phenotype data. We illustrate the methods on both simulated examples, and to a genome-wide association study of blood lipid traits where we identify 18 potential novel genetic associations that were not identified by univariate analyses of the same data.},

  abstract = {{Motivation: Digital gene expression (DGE) technologies measure gene expression by counting sequence tags. They are sensitive technologies for measuring gene expression on a genomic scale, without the need for prior knowledge of the genome sequence. As the cost of sequencing DNA decreases, the number of DGE datasets is expected to grow dramatically.Various tests of differential expression have been proposed for replicated DGE data using binomial, Poisson, negative binomial or pseudo-likelihood (PL) models for the counts, but none of the these are usable when the number of replicates is very small.Results: We develop tests using the negative binomial distribution to model overdispersion relative to the Poisson, and use conditional weighted likelihood to moderate the level of overdispersion across genes. Not only is our strategy applicable even with the smallest number of libraries, but it also proves to be more powerful than previous strategies when more libraries are available. The methodology is equally applicable to other counting technologies, such as proteomic spectral counts.Availability: An R package can be accessed from http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/resources/Contact:smyth@wehi.edu.auSupplementary information:http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/resources/}},

  abstract               = {In numerous applications, from working with animal models to mapping the genetic basis of human disease susceptibility, knowing whether a single disrupting mutation in a gene is likely to be deleterious is useful. With this goal in mind, a number of measures have been developed to identify genes in which protein-truncating variants (PTVs), or other types of mutations, are absent or kept at very low frequency in large population samples-genes that appear 'intolerant' to mutation. One measure in particular, the probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI), has been widely adopted. This measure was designed to classify genes into three categories, null, recessive and haploinsufficient, on the basis of the contrast between observed and expected numbers of PTVs. Such population-genetic approaches can be useful in many applications. As we clarify, however, they reflect the strength of selection acting on heterozygotes and not dominance or haploinsufficiency.},

Here we analyze a broad set of functional elements, including cell type-specific elements, to estimate their polygenic contributions to heritability in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 17 complex diseases and traits with an average sample size of 73,599. To enable this analysis, we introduce a new method, stratified LD score regression, for partitioning heritability from GWAS summary statistics while accounting for linked markers. This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes and leverages genome-wide information. Our findings include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits, a very large immunological disease-specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers and many cell type-specific enrichments, including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in the heritability of body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment and smoking behavior.},

  abstract = {Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable childhood behavioral disorder affecting 5% of children and 2.5% of adults. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ADHD susceptibility, but no variants have been robustly associated with ADHD. We report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 20,183 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 35,191 controls that identifies variants surpassing genome-wide significance in 12 independent loci, finding important new information about the underlying biology of ADHD. Associations are enriched in evolutionarily constrained genomic regions and loss-of-function intolerant genes and around brain-expressed regulatory marks. Analyses of three replication studies: a cohort of individuals diagnosed with ADHD, a self-reported ADHD sample and a meta-analysis of quantitative measures of ADHD symptoms in the population, support these findings while highlighting study-specific differences on genetic overlap with educational attainment. Strong concordance with GWAS of quantitative population measures of ADHD symptoms supports that clinical diagnosis of ADHD is an extreme expression of continuous heritable traits.},

We observe a mean of 26 somatic single-nucleotide variants per brain present in ≥4% of cells, with enrichment of mutations in coding and putative regulatory regions. Our analysis reveals that the first cell division after fertilization produces ~3.4 mutations, followed by 2-3 mutations in subsequent generations. This suggests that a typical individual possesses ~80 somatic single-nucleotide variants present in ≥2% of cells-comparable to the number of de novo germline mutations per generation-with about half of individuals having at least one potentially function-altering somatic mutation somewhere in the cortex. ASD brains show an excess of somatic mutations in neural enhancer sequences compared with controls, suggesting that mosaic enhancer mutations may contribute to ASD risk.},

  abstract  = {Although mutation provides the fuel for phenotypic evolution, it also imposes a substantial burden on fitness through the production of predominantly deleterious alleles, a matter of concern from a human-health perspective. Here, recently established databases on de novo mutations for monogenic disorders are used to estimate the rate and molecular spectrum of spontaneously arising mutations and to derive a number of inferences with respect to eukaryotic genome evolution. Although the human per-generation mutation rate is exceptionally high, on a per-cell division basis, the human germline mutation rate is lower than that recorded for any other species. Comparison with data from other species demonstrates a universal mutational bias toward A/T composition, and leads to the hypothesis that genome-wide nucleotide composition generally evolves to the point at which the power of selection in favor of G/C is approximately balanced by the power of random genetic drift, such that variation in equilibrium genome-wide nucleotide composition is largely defined by variation in mutation biases. Quantification of the hazards associated with introns reveals that mutations at key splice-site residues are a major source of human mortality. Finally, a consideration of the long-term consequences of current human behavior for deleterious-mutation accumulation leads to the conclusion that a substantial reduction in human fitness can be expected over the next few centuries in industrialized societies unless novel means of genetic intervention are developed.},

The genetic variation associated with mental disorders has heretofore been based on the search for rare or common variation in blood cells. This search is based on the premise that every somatic cell shares an identical DNA sequence, so that variation found in lymphocytes should reflect variation present in brain cells. Evidence from the study of cancer cells, stem cells and now neurons demonstrate that this premise is false. Somatic mutation is common in human cells and has been implicated in a range of diseases beyond cancer. The exuberant proliferation of cortical precursors during fetal development provides a likely environment for somatic mutation in neuronal and glial lineages. Studies of rare neurodevelopmental disorders, such as hemimegencephaly, demonstrate somatic mutations in affected cortical cells that cannot be detected in unaffected parts of the brain or in peripheral cells. This perspective argues for the need to investigate somatic variation in the brain as an explanation of the discordance in monozygotic twins, a proximate cause of mental disorders in individuals with inherited risk, and a potential guide to novel treatment targets.},

  abstract               = {We previously estimated that 42% of patients with severe developmental disorders carry pathogenic de novo mutations in coding sequences. The role of de novo mutations in regulatory elements affecting genes associated with developmental disorders, or other genes, has been essentially unexplored. We identified de novo mutations in three classes of putative regulatory elements in almost 8,000 patients with developmental disorders. Here we show that de novo mutations in highly evolutionarily conserved fetal brain-active elements are significantly and specifically enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders. We identified a significant twofold enrichment of recurrently mutated elements. We estimate that, genome-wide, 1-3% of patients without a diagnostic coding variant carry pathogenic de novo mutations in fetal brain-active regulatory elements and that only 0.15% of all possible mutations within highly conserved fetal brain-active elements cause neurodevelopmental disorders with a dominant mechanism. Our findings represent a robust estimate of the contribution of de novo mutations in regulatory elements to this genetically heterogeneous set of disorders, and emphasize the importance of combining functional and evolutionary evidence to identify regulatory causes of genetic disorders.},

  abstract = {Most psychiatric disorders are moderately to highly heritable. The degree to which genetic variation is unique to individual disorders or shared across disorders is unclear. To examine shared genetic etiology, we use genome-wide genotype data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) for cases and controls in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We apply univariate and bivariate methods for the estimation of genetic variation within and covariation between disorders. SNPs explained 17-29% of the variance in liability. The genetic correlation calculated using common SNPs was high between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (0.68 ± 0.04 s.e.), moderate between schizophrenia and major depressive disorder (0.43 ± 0.06 s.e.), bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (0.47 ± 0.06 s.e.), and ADHD and major depressive disorder (0.32 ± 0.07 s.e.), low between schizophrenia and ASD (0.16 ± 0.06 s.e.) and non-significant for other pairs of disorders as well as between psychiatric disorders and the negative control of Crohn's disease. This empirical evidence of shared genetic etiology for psychiatric disorders can inform nosology and encourages the investigation of common pathophysiologies for related disorders.},
