# BSM research

## What's this?

* my computational research project on brain somatic mosaicism (BSM)
* the history of related statistical DNA analysis a.k.a my **lab notebook**
* collection of scripts and small data sets for project-related computation
* slides for scientific presentations

## Introduction

The present research project has been conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Andy Chess' laboratory, which is part of an NIH funded research consortium called Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network (BSMN).  Short, general information on the BSMN is available on its website [http://brainsomaticmosaicism.org/](http://brainsomaticmosaicism.org/).  A more extensive document of general information is the review article authored by the BSMN ([Science. 2017 Apr 28;356(6336). pii: eaal1641.](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6336/eaal1641)).

Within the BSMN this research project is specific in that it investigates the role of somatic mosaicism in schizophrenia somatic variants are called from deep DNA sequencing data from sample pairs.  The paired sample approach, originally developed in cancer research, allows a more accurate calling of somatic variants in the face of germline variants.
